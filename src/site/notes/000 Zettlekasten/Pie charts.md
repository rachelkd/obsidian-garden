- Frequency of each category is represented as a slice of a circle
- Disadvantages of a **pie chart**:
	- Humans are generally bad at estimating quantities from angles
	- Can be hard to match labels to slices

> [!note]
> Best to avoid pie charts in general. Use [[000 Zettlekasten/Barplots\|bar charts]] instead.
