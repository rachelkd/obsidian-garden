From [[10.5 Stacks]], the Stack ADT can be implemented in two ways:
1. Storing the top of the stack at the end of the list (`Stack1`)
2. Storing the top of the stack at the front of the list (`Stack2`)

Different implementations, but share the same *public interface* of the Stack ADT
# The Stack abstract class

Consider the `Stack` class that consists only of the *public interface* of the Stack ADT:
```python
from typing import Any


class Stack:
    """A last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of items.

    This is an abstract class. Only subclasses should be instantiated.
    """

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this stack contains no items.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add a new element to the top of this stack.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the element at the top of this stack.

        Raise an EmptyStackError if this stack is empty.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError


class EmptyStackError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when calling pop on an empty stack."""
```

- Mark a method as unimplemented by having its body raise a special exception, `NotImplementedError`
- A method is **abstract** when
	- not implemented and raises this error
- A class is **abstract** when
	- at least one of its methods is abstract (i.e., not implemented)
- A class is **concrete**
	- when a class is not abstract

### Calling Stack ADT operations causes errors

```python
>>> s = Stack()
>>> s.push(30)
Traceback...
NotImplementedError
>>> s.pop()
Traceback...
NotImplementedError
```

# Inheritance

- `Stack` class:
	- direct translation of the Stack ADT
	- an **interface** that describes the methods that a concrete class that wants to implement the Stack ADT *must* define

## Inheriting the Stack abstract class

We can indicate the relationship between `Stack1` and `Stack2` through **inheritance**

```python
class Stack1(Stack):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new empty stack.
        """
        self._items = []

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """..."""
        return self._items == []

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """..."""
        self._items.append(item)

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """..."""
        return self._items.pop()


class Stack2(Stack):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new empty stack.
        """
        self._items = []

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """..."""
        return self._items == []

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """..."""
        self._items.insert(0, item)

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """..."""
        return self._items.pop(0)
```

- In the class headers, syntax `(Stack)` indicates
	- `Stack1` and `Stack2` inherit from `Stack`

### Describing inheritance relationships

- `Stack`:
	- **superclass** or **parent class**
- `Stack1`, `Stack2`:
	- **subclass** or **child class**

### `isinstance`

```python
>>> stack1 = Stack1()
>>> isinstance(stack1, Stack1)
True
>>> isinstance(stack1, Stack)
True
>>> isinstance(stack1, Stack2)
False
```

> [!note]
> Python interpreter treats every instance of the subclass as an instance of the superclass

## Inheritance serves as another form of *contract*

When the superclass is abstract, the subclass must implement all abstract methods from the superclass, without changing the public interface of those methods.

- The creator of the subclass must implement the methods from the abstract superclass.
- Any user of the subclass may assume that they can call the superclass methods on instances of the subclass.

> [!note] 
> We can use inheritance in Python to express a *shared public interface* between multiple classes:
> - `Stack1` and `Stack2` are subclasses of `Stack` → must implement all the stack methods
> - Can also implement *additional* methods that are unique to each subclass (*not* shared)

# Writing polymorphic code using inheritance

```python
def push_and_pop(stack: Stack, item: Any) -> None:
    """Push and pop the given item onto the stack stack."""
    stack.push(item)
    stack.pop()
```

- Type annotation for `stack` is the abstract class `Stack`
	- `push_and_pop` can be called with *any* instance of any `Stack` subclass

> [!note] 
> 1. Python interpreter *dynamically looks up (or resolves) the `stack.push`/`stack.pop` method*
> 	- Actual method called by `stack.push`/`stack.pop` changes depending on the argument passed to `push_and_pop`
> 2. `push_and_pop` function is **polymorphic**
> 	- Can take as inputs values of different concrete data types and select a specific method based on the type of input.

- Support for polymorphism requires “object dot notation” style of method call vs. “class dot notation” style

# Application: running timing experiments on stack implementation

- Both `Stack1` and `Stack2` are different implementations of the same interface
- Can use polymorphism to help us measure the performance of each
- We time the `push_and_pop` function
	1. With a `Stack1` object
	2. With a `Stack2` object

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Import the main timing function.
    from timeit import timeit

    # The stack sizes we want to try.
    STACK_SIZES = [1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000]
    for stack_size in STACK_SIZES:
        stack1 = Stack1()
        stack2 = Stack2()

        # Bypass the Stack interface to create a stack of size <stack_size>.
        # This speeds up the experiment, but we know this violates
        # encapsulation!
        stack1._items = list(range(0, stack_size))
        stack2._items = list(range(0, stack_size))

        # Call push_and_pop(stack1) 1000 times, and store the time taken.
        t1 = timeit('push_and_pop(stack1, 10)', number=1000, globals=globals())
        t2 = timeit('push_and_pop(stack2, 10)', number=1000, globals=globals())

        print(f'Stack size {stack_size:>8}; Stack1 time {t1}; Stack2 time {t2}')
```
