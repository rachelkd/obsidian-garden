Consider this version of `Stack.pop`, which removes the precondition that `self._items_` is not empty:

```python
    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the element at the top of this stack.
        """
        return self._items.pop()
```

When we call `pop` on an empty stack, we encounter the following error:

```python
>>> s = Stack()
>>> s.pop()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
  File "...", line 58, in pop
    return self._items.pop()
IndexError: pop from empty list
```

- Raise exception → stops normal control flow of currently running program
- **Bad**: exceptions report refers to a list (“`IndexError: pop from empty list`”) and a private attribute (`self._items`) that the client code should have no knowledge of
# Custom exceptions

Raise a custom exception that is descriptive, yet does not reveal and implementation details:
- Define our own type of error

```python
class EmptyStackError(Exception):
	"""Exception raised when calling pop on an empty stack."""
```

- `(Exception)` that follows the class name indicates *[[10.9 Defining a Shared Public Interface with Inheritance|inheritance]]*.

### Consider how we use `EmptyStackError` in `Stack.pop` method:
```python
	def pop(self) -> Any:
		"""Remove and return the element at the top of this stack.
		
		Raise an EmptyStackError if this stack is empty.
		"""
		if self.is_empty():
			raise EmptyStackError
		else:
			return self._items.pop()
```

- Two important changes in this `pop`:
	1. Method docstring: names both the type of exception and scenario that will cause that exception to be raised
		- Part of the *public interface* of `Stack.pop`
		- Users will be expected to take note of this exception
	2. Implementation uses `raise`, which raises an exception
		- **Raise statement** can be used anywhere in code to raise exceptions

### Calling `pop` on an empty stack

```python
>>> s = Stack() 
>>> s.pop() 
Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
	File "...", line 60, in pop
		raise EmptyStackError
 EmptyStackError
```

# Custom exception messages

> [!note] 
> To define a custom exception message, we can define a new special method `__str__` in our exception class.

```python
class EmptyStackError(Exception):
	"""Exception raised when calling pop on an empty stack."""
	
	def __str__(self) -> str:
		"""Return a string representation of this error."""
		return 'pop may not be called on an empty stack'
```

```python
>>> s = Stack()
>>> s.pop() 
Traceback (most recent call last):   
	File "<input>", line 1, in <module>   
	File "...", line 60, in pop     
		raise EmptyStackError 
EmptyStackError: pop may not be called on an empty stack
```

# Testing exceptions

- `EmptyStackError` becomes part of the *public interface* of `Stack.pop` method
	- Should write tests to check that this behaviour occurs as expected
- Raising error interrupts regular control flow of Python program
	- includes test cases
	- → Cannot simply call `pop` on an empty stack and check return value or state of stack after `pop` returns

### Using `pytest.raises`

- `pytest` module allows us to write tests that expects an exception to occur using a function `pytest.raises` with the `with` keyword

```python
# Assuming our stack implementation is contained in a file stack.py.
from stack import Stack, EmptyStackError
import pytest


def test_empty_stack_error() -> None:
    """Test that popping from an empty stack raises an exception."""
    s = Stack()

    with pytest.raises(EmptyStackError):
        s.pop()
```

- `with` keyword acts as an assertion
	- expects `EmptyStackError` to be raised by body of the `with` block (`s.pop()`)
- Test *passes* when exception is raised
- Test *fails* when exception is not raised
	- includes case when a different exception is raised instead of the expected one

# Handling exceptions

- Exception is raised → normal execution of program is stopped → exception is reported to the user

How does `pytest.raises` circumvent this?

## Try-except statement

- try-except statement
	- compound statement
	- execute a block of code and handle a case where one or more pre-specified exceptions are raised in that block

```python
try:
	<statement> 
	...
except <ExceptionClass>:
	<statement>
	...
```

When a try-except statement is executed:

1. Block of code indented within the `try` is executed
2. If no exception occurs:
	- `except` part is skipped
	- Python interpreter continues to the next statement after the try-except
3. If an exception occurs:
	- Exception has type `<ExceptionClass>`:
		- Block under `except` is executed
		- Python interpreter continues executing the next statement after the try-except
	- Exception is **not** `<ExceptionClass>`
		- Normal program execution is stopped

## Applications of try-except statements

- Client code often uses try-except statements to call functions that may raise an error as part of their *public interface*
	- Shields users from seeing errors they should never see
	- Allows the rest of program to continue

**Implement a function that takes a stack and returns the second item from the top of the stack:**

```python
def second_from_top(s: Stack) -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the item that is second from the top of s.

    If there is no such item in the Stack, returns None.
    """
    try:
        hold1 = s.pop()
    except EmptyStackError:
        # In this case, s is empty. We can return None.
        return None

    try:
        hold2 = s.pop()
    except EmptyStackError:
        # In this case, s had only one element.
        # We restore s to its original state and return None.
        s.push(hold1)
        return None

    # If we reach this point, both of the previous
    # s.pop() calls succeeded.
    # In this case, we restore s to its original state and
    # return the second item.
    s.push(hold2)
    s.push(hold1)

    return hold2
```
