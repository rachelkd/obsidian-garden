# The Priority Queue ADT

- Priority Queue ADT
	- Similar to [[000 Zettlekasten/10.7 Queues\|queues]]
	- Every item has some measure of its ‚Äúpriority‚Äù
	- Items are removed in order of their priority; ties are broken in **FIFO** order
- Data:
	- collection of items and their priorities
- Operations:
	- determine whether the priority queue is empty
	- add an item with a priority (*enqueue*)
	- remove highest priority item (*dequeue*)

Note that priorities can be represented in different ways. In this case, largest integer = higher priorities
