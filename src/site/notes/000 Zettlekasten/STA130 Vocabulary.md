Steps for a hypothesis test
?
1. State null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
2. Calculate test stat based on one observed random sample
3. Simulate samples under null hypothesis and calculate the statistic for the simulated sample. Repeat multiple times (constitutes estimated sampling distribution)
4. Evaluate evidence against null by calculating p-value
5. Make a conclusion based on strength of evidence against $H_{0}$

statistical inference
?
- process of drawing conclusions about a population based on info from a sample
- observe outcomes (data) from sample → determine how likely we are to have certain underlying probability (parameter)

population
?
- **entire group** of individuals about whom we hope to draw conclusions on
- e.g., all possible spins of the Wheel of Destiny

random sample
?
- subset of *population* chosen in such a way that every member has an equal chance of being selected

sampling distribution
?
- probability distribution of a statistic that is obtained through repeated sampling of a specific population
- describes a range of possible outcomes for a statistic (e.g., mean or mode of some variable) of a population

simulation
?
- computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudo-random sampling

simulation statistic
?
- derived from simulated data
- mimicking real world observations

test statistic
?
- number calculated from a statistical test of a hypothesis
- shows how closely observed data matches the *distribution* expected under the null hypothesis of that statistical test
- used to calculate p-value of results → decide whether to reject null hypothesis

p-value
?
- probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed value if the null hypothesis is true

Type I error (false positive)
?
- rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true
- probability of making a Type I error is denoted by $\alpha$ (significance level of the test)

Type II error (false negative)
?
- failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false
- probability of making a Type II error is denoted by $\beta$
