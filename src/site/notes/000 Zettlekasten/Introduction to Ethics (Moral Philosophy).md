    - Branch of philosophy
    - Involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behaviour

# Metaethics

According to philosophers Richard Garner and Bernard Rosen, there are three kinds of meta-ethical problems:
1. Moral semantics: What is the meaning of moral terms and judgements?
2. Moral ontology: What is the nature of moral judgements?
3. Moral epistemology: How might moral judgements be supported or defended?

> [!important]- Two main viewpoints
> 1. Cognitivism
> 2. Non-cognitivism

## Cognitivism

- What is **cognitivism**?
    - Ethical statements are ==propositions, statements, or assertions==
    - Can either be true or false

### Three main sections of cognitive moral statements:

1. Realism
2. Subjectivism
3. Error Theory

# Cognitive Theories
## Realism

- There are objective good and bad features to the world, which these propositions are about
    - i.e., There are specific good and bad rules that apply to everyone no matter what
- Moral realists may also believe morality and objective rules are handed down to by a deity
    - e.g., Judeo-Christian God

Realism can be said to be:
1. **Ethical naturalists**, or
2. **Ethical non-naturalists**
### Ethical naturalism

- Ethical claims can be expressed as *natural properties without the use of ethical terms*
- e.g., something like “bad” can be reduced to some natural property:
    - “bad” → pain
        - Study how pain is inflicted on a person → investigating the moral concept of “badness”
    - “good” → well-being 
- Ethical naturalist, neuroscientist ==Sam Harris==:
    - Inflicting intense suffering on anything conscious is objectively morally wrong
    - Analogy of hot stove:
        - Touching the stove will be undeniably painful
        - Something everyone can agree on
        - Can be used to form the basis of good and bad
        - Badness $\implies$ Suffering of conscious creators
#### “Is-ought” Problem

- Problem about ethical naturalism from philosopher ==David Hune==
- People take how things are or empirical facts about the world, and use them to derive moral conclusions illogically
- People move too readily from observations of facts to moral judgements
- Shouldn’t be any connection between empirical facts and values
### Ethical non-naturalism

- There are objective and irreducible moral properties
    - e.g., property of “goodness”
- Philosopher ==G.E. Moore==:
    - We know things like “good” and “bad” just by seeing them
    - Like we know the colour blue by intuition
    - Of course, if it were that easy and true, there would not be so many moral disagreements
# Subjectivism

- Moral statements are made true or false by only individuals or groups of inviduals
    - e.g., specific cultures
- No objective good and bad
- Only individuals or groups of individuals *determine* what is moral

One can be an:
1. **Individual subjectivist**
2. **Cultural subjectivist**

## Individual subjectivism

- Only individuals themselves determine what is moral
- Do not have to account for a deity or some objective fact that provides our moral grounds
- Does lead to some startling conclusions:
    - e.g., genocide under Hitler was morally good
        - To the Nazis, that was something that had to be done for some sort of moral greater good at the time

## Cultural subjectivism

- Only groups of individuals determine what is moral
    - i.e., Morals and ethics are made up by us and come from us
- Societies will treat those morals as the correct ones
- Also referred to as **moral conventionalism** or **moral constructivism**
- States that morals can be judged by different cultures; each culture will treat their morals as the correct one
    - vs. individual subjectivism: others can’t judge morals

## Error Theory

- Although ethical claims do express propositions, all such propositions are ==false==
- No such thing as moral truth → all moral statements are wrong $\implies$ error

# Non-cognitivist theories

> [!def]- Non-cognitivism
> - Ethical statements are ==not propositions== → no truth status
> - Another type of moral anti-realism
> - States that we ==cannot know anything about morality==
> - $\implies$ No point in trying to determine right or wrong statements

## Emotivism

- Ethical sentences merely express emotions
    - e.g., “Lying is wrong” appears to be about a factual description of something
- ==A.J. Ayer==, key figure in the logical positivist movement, claims that when someone makes such a statement, they are really just *expressing an emotion*, not a claim
    - e.g., “I’m lying; that makes me upset”

## Prescriptivism

- Moral statements function like universalized imperative sentences
    - i.e., Moral statements are just giving a command
- ==R.M. Hare==

Which view is correct? That depends on **moral epistemology**.

# Moral epistemology

> [!def]- Moral epistemology
> - Deals with how moral knowledge is possible and derived

- To make a moral claim about reality, one must have *evidence* to support the premises
    - e.g., to claim that morality is objective and derived from a God, one would have to demonstrate how to get moral knowledge from a God, if one exists in the first place

> [!def]- Rational knowledge
> - Morality can be known by reason
> - Including “a prori” facts
>     - Plato and Immanuel Kant

> [!def]- Empirical knowledge
> - Moral knowledge may include evidence by observation
>     - e.g., scientific studies:
>         - Studies into the nature of the mind
>         - Neuromodulators, or special chemicals like oxytocin, influence moral decisions
>         - Evidence can go towards supporting a theory of morality

# Normative ethics

- Picks off where metaethics leaves off

> [!def]- Normative ethics
> - Studies *systems* of morality
> - Standards of right and wrong actions
> - One ultimate criterion of moral conduct in normative ethics:
>     - A set of rules or principles, usually

### Systems of ethics

1. **Deontology**
2. **Consequentialism**
3. **Virtue ethics**

## Deontology

> [!def]- Deontology
> - Theory that the morality of an action should be determined by whether the action itself is right or wrong *under a series of rules*
> - Referred to as ==“rule-based ethics”==

- Kantian ethics argues:
    - Only truly good thing is the will or motive of a person, and how they act
    - Not what happens after they act
- Kant: formulated **categorical imperative**
    - “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”
    - i.e., We should come up with and live by certain rules, or *categorical imperatives*, no matter what
    - Figure them out by asking ourselves whether we would want to live in a world where everyone takes that same particular action
        - e.g., If a psychopath or killer wanted to kill your friend, and friend hid inside your house, if the murderer came on the door and asked if your friend was hiding there, the morally correct thing to do is to say: “Yes”
        - We can all agree that we wouldn’t want to live in a world where we lie to each other
        - → Kant argued that ==honesty is a categorical imperative==, even if it ends in the death of our innocent friend

Perhaps a better moral system to live by depends on the *consequences* on actions, rather than someone’s personal attack: **consequentialism**

## Consequentialism

> [!def]- Consequentialism
> - Theory that the consequences of one’s conduct are the *ultimate basis* for any judgement about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct
> - Consequential theories are sometimes called **teleological** theories

### Utilitarianism

> [!def]- Utilitarianism
> - Ethical theory that states that the most moral action is one that *maximizes happiness and well-being* for the affected individuals

- Most popular consequentialist theory
- Developed by ==Jeremy Bentham== and ==John Stuart Mill== in the 18th century
- Actions should not be considered good or bad in and of themselves
    - only in *reference* to their **utility** i.e., usefulness in achieving happiness

# Virtue Ethics

Perhaps being moral is more about *good habits* of character vs. actions and consequences.

> [!def]- Virtue ethics
> - Normative theory that emphasizes the *virtues* or the *moral character* of an individual

- Less emphasis on learning rules
- More importance of ==developing good habits and character==
- Oldest types of normative ethics with roots in Ancient Greece

## Cardinal virtues

Plato outlined:
1. Wisdom
2. Courage
3. Temperance
4. Justice

Aristotle argued:
- Most virtues fall between two extremes, which we ought to avoid
- e.g., Too much courage → become brash; too little → cowardly

# Applied Ethics

> [!def]- Applied ethics
> - Consists of the analysis of specific, controversial moral issues

- Today, applied ethics is often sorted into *subbranches* to deal with specific topics
    - e.g., medical ethics, business ethics, environmental ethics, or sexual ethics
- For example:
    - Medical ethics: embryonic stem cell research controversy, ending life support debate
    - Environmental ethics: shutting down specific emissions-producing businesses to stop global warming
