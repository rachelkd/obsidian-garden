# Terminal commands

`pwd`
- Present working directory
    ```
    pwd
    /Users/rachel/Desktop/CSC207/csc207
    ```

`git commit -m "Added a line"`

- What is the *origin*?
    - The current file? im not sure what he said

`git branch new-line`

`git checkout new-line`
- Switches branch to `new-line`

`git checkout -b new-branch`
- does the same thing as `git branch ...` and `git checkout ...`

can you `git add` a file and make changes then `commit` it afterwards? or do u have to add it again when changes are made BEFORE committing
