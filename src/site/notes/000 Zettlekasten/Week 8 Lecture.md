> [!important] Definition of cycle. #definition 
> Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph.
> - A **cycle** in $G$ is a sequence of vertices $v_{0}, \dots, v_{k}$ satisfying the following conditions:
> 	1. $k \ge 3$
> 	2. $v_{0} = v_{k}$, and all other vertices are distinct from each other and $v_{0}$
> 	3. Each consecutive pair of vertices is adjacent

## Connectedness redundancy

- Are all vertices in any cycle connected to each other?
    - Yes
- If we remove one edge, will all the vertices that were in the cycle still be connected?
    - Yes

> [!info] Lemma 1.
> Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and $e \in E$.
> If $G$ is connected and $e$ is in a cycle of $G$, then the graph obtained by removed $e$ from $G$ is still connected.
> $$\forall G = (V, E), \forall e \in E, (G \text{ is connected} \; \land \; e \text{ is in a cycle of } G) \implies G - e \text{ is connected}$$

Proof in [[100 ðŸ“’ Academia/CSC111/Course Notes/Cycles and Trees#Prove that this property holds when this cycle is part of a larger graph\|17.6]].

- If $w_1$ and $w_2$ are connected in $G$, what does that mean exists in $G$ (in terms of paths)?
    - There is a path containing 2 or more vertices

## Another property

> [!info] Lemma 2. (Converse of Lemma 1.)
> Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. If there exists an edge $e \in E$ such that $G-e$ is connected, then that edge $e$ is in a cycle in $G$, the original graph.
> - Note: In this case, $G$ is also connected.
