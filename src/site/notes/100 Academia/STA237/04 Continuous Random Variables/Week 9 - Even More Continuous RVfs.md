> [!goal]- Learning Objectives
> - Learn about **exponential** and **gamma** distributions
>     - Determine probabilities, quantiles, and expected values (incl. variances) using pdfs, cdfs, mgfs, and R
> - Apply cdf method (or, if appropriate, the method of transformations) to determine the pdf of a function of a continuous random variable
