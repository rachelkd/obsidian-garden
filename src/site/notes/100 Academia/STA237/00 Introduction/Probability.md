> Probability begins with some activity, process, or experiment whose outcome is uncertain. (Wagaman, 2021)

Let $A$ be an event associated with some random experiment. 
Imagine conducting the experiment over and over, infinitely often, keeping track how much $A$ occurs.
- **Trial:**
    - Each experiment
- **Success:**
    - If $A$ occurs when experiment is performed
- **Relative frequency** interpretation of probability:
    - the *proportion of successes*, $P(A)$
    - $\implies$ the probability of an event is equal to its relative frequency in a large number of trials

> [!important] To define probability carefully, we need to take a formal, axiomatic, mathematical approach.
