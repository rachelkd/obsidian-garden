> [!goal]- Learning Objectives
> - Obtain marginal expected values and variances using conditional expectations and variances
> - Find the joint pdf/pmf of two new random variables defined as functions of $X$ and $Y$ based on $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ using the method of transformations
> - Use mgfs to determine the probability distribution of the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables
