> [!info]- Learning Objectives
> 1. Define conditional probability and describe the difference between P(A|B) and P(B|A).
> 2. Distinguish between mutually exclusive (disjoint) and independent events.
> 3. Assess whether or not events are independent.
> 4. Represent an event as several disjoint subsets to compute its probability using the law of total probability.
> 5. Recognize the difference between conditional and unconditional events and use appropriate rules (e.g., multiplication rule, Bayes' theorem) to solve problems.
