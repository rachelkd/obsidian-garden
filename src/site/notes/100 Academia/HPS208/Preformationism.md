# Preformationism

> [!info]+ Key terms
> - Preformationism
> - Epigenesis
> - Embryonic Development

## Review

- Last week:
    - Talked about the history of [[100 Academia/HPS208/Mechanism\|mechanism]]
- Mechanism replaced the Aristotelian worldview
    - Mostly
    - Aristotelian worldview had a picture that was intuitive, human-centred, full of things of meaning, purposes, goals
        - Matter interfacing with form
        - Form of a thing is as real as its matter
            - (and purpose)
        - Two are mutually required to make a thing into what it is
    - Reduced to ==matter pushing matter== (in mechanism)
- Mechanism was a good research strategy
    - Helped with a lot of research in physics, chemistry
    - Mechanism comes with an implicit research strategy:
        - Look at something complex
        - Break it down into parts
        - Understand the parts
        - Put it back together to understand the overall thing
    - For Descartes: cut the animal into parts, understand the parts, then put the parts back together (conceptually, for animals) to understand the whole thing
- While mechanism seems to have been a really good framework for thinking, it left something to be desired when applied to living things
    - When you cut a living thing into parts, it is not a living thing anymore
    - While physicists and chemists were trying to exercise all this teleological language of purpose and function:
        - Biologists the whole time were using purposive and functional language
            - e.g., Legs are for walking, eyes are for seeing, hearts are for pumping blood
                - Teleological language
    - You cannot do biology without using Aristotelian language

### Cartesian Dualism

- Descartes specifically thought:
    - Impossible to explain *human minds* mechanistically
- But was pretty okay with the idea that the rest of life could be explained mechanically

### This Week

- Talk about some struggles to reconcile *mechanism* with what was known about *living things*
    - Not just the human mind, but living things in general
- Lots of features of life are hard to explain mechanically
    - Focus specifically on **embryonic development**
        - Embryo to an individual to an adult
        - Still remains hard to explain to this day!

## Embryology in Aristotle

- Aristotle:
    - Reports having studied the development of embryos by opening chicken eggs
        - One per day of development
    - Saw development in terms of *matter* and *form*
        - & Sperm provides the *efficient*, *final*, and *formal* cause
        - & Eggs provide the *matter*
            - Saw eggs as unstructured matter; unformed
            - Sperm puts its form on that
    - & Saw development as the *==form of the animal imposing itself on unstructured matter==*
        - Start as an undifferentiated clump of cells
        - A bunch of very articulate parts put themselves together somehow
        - Aristotle sees this as *form imposing itself on matter*
            - Form is as real as matter for him
            - e.g., The form of a chicken was doing the work of turning the unstructured matter into a chicken
                - Doing that with the goal of producing a chicken
    - & Development is guided by its *purpose*
        - The development of the adult animal

> [!note]+ With those conceptual resources, Aristotle does not have much difficulty with embryogenesis.
> - Has the idea of form that exists semi-independently from matter
> - Has the idea of natural purposes
> - → Gives good machinery to explain embryology
>     - The egg wants to become a chicken (goal); has the form to get it there

### Pangenesis

![](https://i.imgur.com/9owHIiw.png)

- Aristotle specifically argues against some other theories of embryogenesis around the same time
    - His theory was opposed to others e.g., **pangenesis**
- **Pangenesis**
    - Hippocrates argued for this
    - & The idea that ==every part of the adult body contributes something to the sperm or egg==
        - It is those contributions which give it form
            - Those parts carry some picture of the overall body
            - Sperm, egg use to reconstruct the adult
        - e.g., to make a hand, you need hand gemmules; to make a nose, you need nose gemmules
            - Theory allows for the possibility of inheritance of acquired characteristics
                - e.g., if you work out everyday and get ripped, you have way more muscle gemmules; maybe, your kid gets more muscle gemmules
- % Roughly Darwin’s theory of hereditary
    - Comes up with theory of natural selection without having the benefit of microbiology
    - Thinks it is something like this

> “The races that differ but little from one another I will omit, and describe the condition only of those which differ greatly, whether it be through nature or through custom. I will begin with the Longheads. There is no other race at all with heads like theirs. Originally custom was chiefly responsible for the length of the head, but now custom is reinforced by nature. Those that have the longest heads like theirs. Originally custom was chiefly responsible for the length of the head, but now custom is reinforced by nature. Those that have the longest heads they consider the noblest, and their custom is as follows. As soon as a child is born they remodel its head with their hands, while it is still soft and the body tender, and force it to increase in length by applying bandages and suitable appliances, which spoil the roundness of the head and increase its length. Custom originally so acted that through force such a nature came into being ; but as time went on the process became natural, so that custom no longer exercised compulsion. For the seed comes from all parts of the body, healthy seed from healthy parts, diseased seed from diseased parts.”
>
> (Hippocrates De aere acquis et locis W. H. S. Jones, Ed. Part 14, section XIV)

- Alterations to the body inherited during its life can be inherited in this theory
    - Different from the DNA theory of hereditary
        - Germ-line and soma are fully separated
- % No one knows who the Longheads are that Hippocrates is referring to

### Family Resemblances: Pangenesis vs. Aristotle

- Pangenesis:
    - There is a clear explanation for why we resemble both biological parents
        - The mingling of gemmules of the two parents
- For Aristotle:
    - That needed some further explanation
        - Since sperm provides the form
        - Only the father who provides the form
    - Thought that *disturbances from the maternal side* caused deviations from perfect replication of the father
    - Failure to resemble father exactly is explained by ill humours in the mother or distress

## Malebranche and Preformationism

> [!tldr]+ Reading
> - Chapter from Karen Detlefsen’s *The Life Sicneces in Early Modern Philosophy*
> - About Malebranche’s theories about embryonic development

### Malebranche

- Nicholas Malebranche
    - 1638-1715
    - Catholic priest and philosopher
- Last week:
    - Saw Malebranche’s theory about the relation between bodies and minds
        - **[[100 Academia/HPS208/Mechanism#Occasionalism\|Occasionalism]]**
- % In general, his philosophy is pretty God-focused

### Preformationism

- Malebranche argued for a quite different picture of embryonic development
    - Despite being a big fan of Descartes
    - Preferred view was **preformationism**

> [!def]+ Preformationism
> - Idea that every structure in a living thing exists in the egg/sperm
> - Embryonic development is just feeding matter into pre-existing structures
>     - e.g., expanding a balloon

#### Preformationism: Two Types of Arguments

- Detlefson tells us that there are two basic lines of argument that Malebranche used to *defend preformationism*:
    - **Theological**
    - **Scientific**
- % Also briefly mentions metaphysical arguments from Liebniz

#### Two Theological Arguments

- % We will look at two distinct theological arguments
    - One is about *original sin*
    - Other is about *God’s role* in the *mechanical order of the universe*

#### Theological Argument 1: Original Sin

- **Original sin**
    - Idea that all of humanity was stained by Eve, when in the Garden of Eden, she ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil

Suppose you 100% believe that.

- ? How did that sin stain all of humanity?
    - You were not there at all!
- Preformationism says:
    - & You and I were there, in a very tiny form

<!-- break -->
- The structure of this argument is very weird
    - Trying to prove preformationism
    - The mystery is: How can I be stained by original sin when I was not even there?
    - Says: Well, preformationism explains that; therefore, preformationism is likely true
    - **Inference of the best explanation**
        - If this hypothesis is true, then I should make this observation $O$
        - I make this observation $O$, therefore, likely this hypothesis is true
        - e.g., If somebody stole all my money, then I am broke. I am broke, so probably someone stole all my money

##### Ovism and Spermism

- Two brands of *preformationism*
    - **Spermism**
        - Claims the mini-person is in the *sperm*
    - **Ovism**
        - Claims the mini-person is in the *egg*
    - % You cannot be both (unless you believe that one fights the other to death)
- & Malebranche was an **ovist**
- & We were all inside Eve when the first sin was committed
    - Inside eggs inside eggs inside Eve

#### Theological Argument 2: God the Maker

- Malebranche:
    - Preformationism opens up a perfect space for God to be a creator of all living things without having to constantly intervene
        - Avoids a very literal ‘deus ex machina’
            - God from the machine
            - A seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly solved by an unexpected event
- The world is mechanistic except for the human mind
    - Malebranche is okay with the idea that the human mind is an immortal soul; not a mechanism
    - But also wants the world to roughly be mechanistic
        - Thinks it is a machine unfolding itself
        - Thinks it should not be the case that God is constantly having to get in there to change stuff

##### Occasionalism

- Contradiction?
    - From [[100 Academia/HPS208/Mechanism#Occasionalism\|mechanism]]:
        - Malebranche thought that God intervenes every time we think the mental and physical interact
            - Every time you think that you have a physical sensation — that something material is causing something to happen in your mind — that is God doing a runner between the two
            - Any time you have something physical that causes something physical, God is intervening there
- ? How could “God the Maker” possibly be an argument that Malebranche wants to endorse given that he also thinks that God does everything always?

##### Simple and General Laws

- Malebranche:
    - Reconcile these using another claim he makes about how God governs the world
- It is a mechanistic world
    - What mechanist means is:
        - God has chosen some simple and general laws to govern the whole universe
        - Mostly sticks by them
        - & God can violate these laws at will in the case of miracles
            - Mostly lets things follow them
            - Occasionally, when he wants to turn water into wine, or make a bush burn, he will allow there to be exceptions to the general laws

#### God the Maker

- For Malebranche:
    - Would be bad for God to be regularly intervening in the course of events in a way that *violates the laws of nature*
- & Preformationism allows for God to have designed us each as individuals
    - Without having to change the rules of embryonic development for each of us
    - God has a plan for you and your specific life; the kind of person you are
        - God is responsible for parts of your personality; designed you as a specific individual
    - ? How could that be if God is always on the fly; reworking us in the womb?
        - Preformationism is the answer
        - Allows a space where God could have designed each and one of us in particular detail
        - Without having to get hands dirty at every conception
        - Planned it all in advance
            - It is all set, and it unfolds
- % This is also Malebranche’s theodicy — explanation of why there is suffering
    - ? If God is so omnipotent, compassionate, omniscient, why does life suck so much? Why do innocent people suffer?
    - Answer is based on simple and general laws
        - God did not have enough time to worry about children getting cancer
        - Created these simple and general laws that govern everything
        - A bunch of bad stuff happens on the regular because these were the simplest laws that God could devise that nonetheless ran the universe the way he wanted to

#### Scientific Arguments

- Detflefson:
    - Gives *two* scientific arguments from Malebranche
        1. First is about how hard it looks to explain embryonic development mechanistically
        2. Second about the *structure* of living things in general

#### Scientific Argument 1: Mechanism and Embryos

- % Malebranche loves Descartes
    - Studies his work intensively
    - & But most people agree that Descartes’ attempt to explain embryonic development is a swing and a miss

> [!quote]+ Detlefson p. 142
> “The evidence for mechanism’s inability to account for generation was produced by Descartes when he attempted to provide such an explanation and, many believed, failed abjectly.”

##### Epigenesis

> [!quote]+ Detlefsen, K. (2014). Biology and Theology in Malebranche’s Theory of Organic Generation. In The Life Sciences in Early Modern Philosophy. Oxford University p.142
> “Descartes’s explanation for the phenomenon of organic generation runs roughly as follows: The seminal fluid from the female and male mix in the uterus. They begin a rapid vortical motion due to extreme heat caused by a sort of fermentation upon the mixing, and from this mechanically moving liquid, the heart, then brain, and then other body parts emerge one by one until a living being is formed.”

- All of it mixes together → then warm → then body parts come
- Even at the time, this was regarded as not impressive at all
    - Descartes is kind of all over in his attempts to give a mechanistic explanation of things
- Inertia is a mystery for the straight mechanists
    - Before Newton:
        - ? How does a thing in motion continue to move?
            - Descartes: There are air vortices behind the thing in the air, giving it another push
                - Using vortices all over his physics
                - That’s why he thinks there is a uterine cyclone
                    - Nobody at the time or since thought that this was a particularly-compelling explanation

##### Birthmarks

- Recall Aristotle:
    - Why don’t children resemble the father perfectly?
        - Father offers the form, purpose, efficient cause
        - Mother provides the raw matter
        - Disturbances from the mother
            - Particularly, mother’s imagination
        - % This runs all the way to Descartes
- Descartes:
    - Attributed the existence of birthmarks to the imagination of pregnant mothers
        - e.g., If a pregnant woman sees a fruit and really wants it, that will imprint a fruit-shaped birthmark
