# Hindu Environmental Ethics

From [[100 Academia/HPS208/Animal Sentience (ASENT)\|Animal Sentience (ASENT)]]:

- Hard to say anything definite about animal sentience without something like a *theory* of sentience in general
    - What does it mean to be sentient?
    - How is sentience realized in a living thing?
- Somewhat unsatisfied with the criteria provided by ASENT
    - As were the authors
    - Relied on behavioural and neurological tests, but
- What we really want to know:
    - ? What is it like from the POV of an organism itself?

We look at this question of sentience and ethics from a broadly Hindu perspective.

- They have an account of what makes something sentient

> [!tldr]+ Framarin (2012)
> - Defends a basic tenant of this debate
>     - & We owe something to non-humans

- Want to explore what the basic Hindu metaphysics of sentience mean for **environmental ethics**

## Environmental Ethics

> [!def]+ Environmental Ethics
> - Sub-discipline that asks what our ==ethical obligations== are towards the natural environment
> - Two forms of obligations:
>     - **Prudential**
>     - **Intrinsic**

- Environmental ethics can include:
    - Humans, animals, plants
    - Sometimes rivers and mountains

### Prudential Obligations

Example of a **prudential** reason:

> [!example]+ Bad idea for humans to burn every forest and boil oceans
> - All humans would likely die
> - Presumably, we care about humans

- Looks at the environment ==as a means to some end==
    - i.e., Keeping us alive
- This is **anthropocentric** reasoning
    - Puts humans at the centre of things
    - “anthro-”:
        - Human
    - “-pocentric”:
        - Put in the middle

### Intrinsic Obligations

- In addition to caring about keeping ourselves alive,
    - Environmental ethics often involves concerns about non-human living things for their ==own sake==
- This type of ethical consideration is **intrinsic**

> [!question] How much consideration do we owe to the interests of non-human organisms?

### The Scope of Environmental Ethics

- In [[100 Academia/HPS208/Animal Sentience (ASENT)\|ASENT]]:
    - Talked about intrinsic value of animals
- Environmental ethics also considers the intrinsic interests of *plants*
- More controversially:
    - Some have argued that we should also consider the intrinsic interests of:
        - Whole ecosystems, or
        - Geological formations e.g., mountains and rivers

#### The Personhood of Rivers

- Various people around the world have assigned personhood to parts of the natural world like mountains
- Morris and Ruru argue that:
    - Rivers should be legally recognized as persons in New Zealand law, since
    - Maori regard them as ancestors
- → Would ==allow human representatives== to argue on their behalf in court
    - In the same way that representatives argue on behalf of a human who cannot do so on their own behalf
- One way authors propose to allow Maori people to get their treaty laws recognized:
    - Allow things like rivers to have legal personhood such that people can argued on their behalf in court
    - Would not have to argue that there is people harm (in polluting, exploiting, or diverting a river)
    - Can instead argue that the river is harmed by this
    - Bar for direct harm is lowered

<!-- break -->
- This isn’t an entirely new thing:
    - Corporations are considered as persons in US law
    - Not obvious why a corporation can have personhood, but not something like rivers
- Person has a definition of the law; being a person entitles you to certain protections
    - [[100 Academia/HPS208/Animal Sentience (ASENT)\|ASENT]]: Animals are mostly considered property
    - Being property does not automatically give you protections
    - To make it illegal to kill an animal that nobody owns: Have to show that somebody was hurt
        - Somebody does not include animal itself (in Canadian law at least)
        - Raises the bar about what counts as harm towards that being

## Main Reading

> [!tldr]+ Framarin (2012)
> - Goal:
>     - Defend the idea that a ==plausible environmental ethic== should ==attribute intrinsic value== to non-human parts of nature
> - In his full book:
>     - Questions: Do the basic tenets of Hinduism offer a plausible environmental ethic?
>     - He argues yes, but why is his concern

### The Last Man

> “The last man (or person) surviving the collapse of the world system lays about him, eliminating, as far as he can, every living thing, animal or plant (but painlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs). What he does is quite permissible according to basic chauvinism \[that is, anthropocentrism], but on environmental grounds what he does is wrong. Moreover one does not have to be committed to esoteric values to regard Mr. Last Man as behaving badly.”

> (Routley, 1973, p. 207)

> [!summary]+ The Last Man Thought Experiment
> - Knows they are the last and there will be no more humans after
> - Only thing that makes them happy is killing everything they can see
> - ? Is that an okay thing to do? Is this ==morally wrong==?
>     - Most would say that is not okay

- Framarin:
    - Notes that this argument seems to intuitively work for both plants and animals
        - If last surviving person burned down an old growth forest for fun, that still seems wrong
            - Even if no animals are hurt
    - Asks us to imagine it is the last person’s final hours alive
        - → Eliminate concern about bad habits developing, etc.
- & It is the destruction itself that seems bad
    - **Immanuel Kant**:
        - Said: Morally wrong for humans to hurt animals without good reasons because you develop habits that are bad
        - e.g., If you kick animals for fun, eventually you are going to kick a toddler
            - $\because$ Training yourself to ignore the sounds of pain
    - Reason why you probably have this intuition is because you believe that there is some *intrinsic value* to non-human things
- & → A plausible environmental ethic should take into account the intrinsic interests of non-human living things
    - This is Framarin’s main argument
