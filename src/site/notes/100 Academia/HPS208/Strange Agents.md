# Strange Agents

## Introduction

- Emma Sigworth:
    - PhD student for IHPST
    - Fascinated with Michael Levin’s work
    - Current responsibility in her own dissertation process to understand Levin better

> [!abstract]+ Last week: The **Living and Nonliving and Anishinaabeg Animisms**
> - Discussed the distinction between living and non-living entities processes
> - How is that distinction understood differently by different people?
> - What does it mean to be alive, what kinds of things are alive, and how should we treat them because they are alive?

> [!abstract]+ This week: **Cognition and Life**
> - Franisek Baluska & Michael Levin, “On Having no Head: Cognition Throughout Biological Systems”, 2016
> - Central thesis:
>     - & All biological systems — at any level of organization — are cognitive agents

- Arguably, this is a wild claim
    - ? How do the authors defend this position?
    - ? *Why* do the authors defend this position?

> [!goal]+ Think about how Baluska and Levin discuss the nature of life and nature of cognition
> - Both Baluska and Levin have distinct scientific projects
> - But Levin, in particular, has this philosophical framework that runs parallel to his empirical research
> - ? What are their philosophical positions?

## Baluska and Levin’s Definition of Cognition

> [!def]+ Cognition
> - The total set of mechanisms and processes that underlie information acquisition, store, processing, and use, at any level of organization

- On this definition of cognition:
    - & Any biological system that processes information is a cognitive system
        - i.e., the criteria for being cognitive is really basic
        - All you need to do is be some kind of information processor
- Baluska and Levin explicitly emphasize they want to talk about information processing systems at any level
    - → They believe that there is a meaningful way to say:
        - & Cytoskeleton of a single cell is an information processor
        - & Because it is an information processor, it is a cognitive system
    - Also:
        - Human heart processes information
            - Deals with signals, integrates and deals with bioelectrical signals
            - → Is a cognitive system
    - All of your individual organs are cognitive agents
    - All of those individual cells are also cognitive agents
    - A lot of the stuff that happens inside of those cells, if arranged in a system form, are also cognitive agents

## Neurons didn’t Invent Cognition — They Optimized it

- Baluska and Levin give us a way to think about cognition in systems without a brain, or any neurons, or even a central nervous system
    - Offer a slogan

> [!quote]+ Neurons didn’t invent cognition — they optimized it
> - One of the key ideas in this paper
> - Also one of the most *technical* ideas

- ; … \[Central Nervous System] neurons do not embody cognition due to any magical, unique property.
    - Neurons do not ‘produce’ cognition simply *because* they are neurons, or because they are part of a brain/CNS
    - According to Baluska and Levin:
        - Cognition does not require a brain at all
            - Probably find this claim very strange
        - They are using a functional definition of cognition
        - Cognition refers to a set of mechanisms or processes that do a certain thing, or produce a certain result
- ; \[The computational powers of neurons] derive from the dynamics of networks of linked elements that propagate and integrate signals, and their ability to alter connectivity among those elements (network topology) based on prior activity \[…]
    - Baluska and Levin are pointing out (in a very technical away) what they think allows a group of neurons to produce cognition
    - Brain or CNS or single neuron has cognitive capacities because it is a system that can transmit and integrate signals and update its configuration based on prior activity
        - Really boiling down the ability to cognize to information processing
        - Information processing is about transmitting and integrating signals and updating based on past signal activity
    - If we understand cognition in such a simple way:
        - Cognition is kind of present everywhere at least in the biological realm
    - This is what they mean when they say…
- ; “These basic properties are present in biological systems at many complexity scales. \[…] Indeed, neurons did not invent their special tricks — they merely optimized them for speed to drive adaptive behaviour” (p. 2)
    - This kind of signal-integrating and configuration-updating capacity is present throughout biological systems
    - While neurons might be the ‘best’ at cognition, they did not ‘invent’ it
        - The brain can do this the fastest, or process information more abstractly
        - But there are a lot more simpler systems in the human and animal body that can do the same kind of thing

## Bioelectricity

> [!idea] A brain/central nervous system has cognitive capacities because ==it is a system that can transmit and integrate signals and update its configuration based on prior activity==.

- Authors argue that brain has cognitive capacities
    - Because it is a system that deals with *signals* in a special kind of way
    - Levin has been studying signal-integration and processing in biological systems for a really long time
- **Developmental bioelectricity**
    - Refers to how electrical signals regulate the development of cells and tissue
    - This way of thinking of the connection between electricity and biology have come probably very naturally to Levin
        - As a developmental biologist
- Bioelectricity is also a major topic in neuroscience
    - Neurons communicate each other using action potentials
    - Rapid changes in electric voltages
    - Action potentials in developmental bioelectricity is kind of present everywhere in the biological world
        - Can find biological states in bacteria, plants, in a single cell
        - No biologist would argue against Levin about this
- & The fact that living systems harness electricity in this specific kind of way has led Levin to understand bioelectricity as a ==unifying principle in biology==
    - Wants bioelectricity to explain a lot of open questions in biology

### Two Claims

#### (1) Theoretical Claim about the Nature of Biological Cognition

- Bioelectricity somehow explains cognition in living systems
- Cognition in *living* systems can be ‘boiled down’ to bioelectricity
- **Cognition is information-processing**
    - Information-processing in living systems occurs via bioelectric signals
    - & Studying bioelectricity should tell us something insightful about cognition

#### (2) Disciplinary Hypothesis: A Better Understanding of Bioelectricity Will Dissolve Disciplinary Distinctions between Brain Sciences and Biology

- ; “Thus, firm (and disciplinary) distinctions between the science of the brain and those of the body are largely artificial hold-overs from past limitations of technology and evolutionary understanding…”
    - (“Bioelectric Networks”, p. 1883)
- Implication:
    - As we learn more about bioelectricity, these artificial hold-overs/distinctions will begin to dissolve
        - e.g., between brain sciences and (developmental) biology

## Information-processing and Cognition

- & Baluska and Levin suggest that information-processing is *sufficient* for cognition
    - Cognition, in some kind of strange way, is mainly a manifestation of bioelectricity
- In order to be a cognitive system:
    - & All a system needs to do is process information
    - Information-processing is ‘enough’, or sufficient for, cognition

> [!question] Is this true?

- Seems like a strangely broad definition of cognition
    - Thermostats or simple living devices that track conditions in the external world qualify as a cognitive system
- Many philosophers would disagree on this position
    - Depending on who you ask, the answer would be no

### Fred Adams, “Information and Cognition” (2016); “Cognition Wars” (2018)

- American philosopher of mind
- Most well-known for criticizing a position called the **Extended Mind Hypothesis**
    - This is out-of-scope for the paper

> [!quote]+ “…the mere fact that a metabolic process or type of behaviour is information-driven is not sufficient for it to be cognitive”
> (2018, p. 27)
>
> - Seems to disagree with Baluska and Levin!

- Adams has something much more belief-driven, knowledge-oriented image of cognition
    - For him:
        - Cognition is about ==mental states==
    - Thinks that information matters for cognition
        - Necessary, but is not sufficient for cognition
- % Adams is not in direct debate with Baluska and Levin
    - But what he has to say in these two papers are a good foil for what Baluska and Levin have to say

#### Adam’s Main Argument

- If information-processing were sufficient enough for cognition:
    - Then we would have to admit that simple information-processing devices like thermometers or thermostats are some kind of cognitive system
    - Simply by virtue of being conduits of information

> [!quote]+ “If being a conduit of information were sufficient for cognition, then the whole universe would think. Despite a few proponents of this view, it seems highly implausible to most”
> (2016, p. 323)

- **Information**
    - Adams believes:
        - Knowledge is caused by information
        - But knowledge also requires a certain about of belief and requires the correct mental states
        - Information is something you can pick up from the world
            - Some kind of signal that the world is a certain way
    - Levin and Baluska:
        - More about the reduction of uncertainty
        - Relying on a much more physics-driven approach
- Adams does not disagree that information is important
    - But if all that we needed to be cognitive was information, then tons of stuff that are informative (i.e., inform us about other states) would be a cognitive system
    - This seems highly implausible
        - Does not seem like Levin is too concerned about this debate
        - Would probably say:
            - “I do not mind that my framework has this sort of entailment”

## How Might Levin (and Baluska) Respond to the charge that Their Definition of Cognition is Too Broad?

- ? What is the purpose of defining cognition as such?
    - Levin wants to encourage cross-pollination of different research tools
    - Talks about behaviour of the embryo growing into an organism
    - Thinks that tools from neuroscience and cognitive science can productively be drawn into this developmental biology context
        - Give us something meaningful to say
        - Open avenues for research
- ? Experimentally, what makes Levin think this is plausible?
    - Had a pretty remarkable experimental successes changing the way that simple groups of cells (and much simpler organisms than humans) behave in the kind of developmental-biology context
    - From his lab:
        - **Xenobots**
            - Living robots made from frog skin cells
        - Had pseudo-organisms created by removing cells from a frog embryo at a certain point in the developmental process
        - Cells were manipulated to create a cell that behaves in a certain way
            - Behaves predictably, in a way that can be controlled
- & Levin and Baluska would not be too worried about our philosophical concerns
    - About the definition being too broad
- & Their philosophical framework is not trying to clarify the ‘true’ nature of life and cognition
    - ; “Our goal … is not to \[define cognition], but to present tools that can help with research”
        - (Manicka & Levin, 2019)
- & This definition is a research tool or ‘useful fiction’
    - Part of the toolkit that Levin is creating involves this working definition of cognition
    - He and his colleagues use this definition as a research tool
    - Definition informs his empirical work

## “On Having no head”, Baluska & Levin, 2016

> [!quote]+ “\[We favour] an intentional stance-like pragmatic, engineering approach grounded in cybernetics”
> (2016, p. 12)

- & This sentence is key to understanding *why* Baluska and levin think about cognition and life in this way

> [!goal]+ For the remainder of the lecture, we work through these three points in turn
> - Intentional stance?
> - Pragmatic approach?
> - Grounded in cybernetics?

- Hopefully, this understanding will help justify this kind of thesis

### Cybernetics

- Norbert Wiener:
    - One of the founders of the scientific study
    - Defined **cybernetics** as:
        - “the science of control and communication, in animals and machines”
            - (1948)
- Ross Ashby (1956):
    - **Cybernetics** is a theory of ‘all possible machines’
    - The field studies “all forms of behaviour in so far as they are regular, determinate, or reproducible”
        - (p. 1)
