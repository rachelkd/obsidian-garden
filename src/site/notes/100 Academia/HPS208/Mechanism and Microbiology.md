## Review

- Last time: [[100 Academia/HPS208/Preformationism\|Preformationism]]
    - A response to the difficulty of reconciling mechanism with embryonic development
        - Talked about Malebranche’s **ovism**
            - We were all inside the egg from our mother before she was born
            - Before she was born, she was in an egg inside her mother
            - And on and on until the dawn of time
- Doubt many people were swayed to become committed preformationists

### Organic Unity and Purposiveness

- One of the central arguments that Malebranche used for preformationism:
    - & Living things look designed
        - Look like they have purposes and goals
    - Furthermore:
        - & Each of their parts depends on the whole organisms for its function
        - e.g., Just a heart does not do you much good without a circulatory system, lungs, nerves, etc.
- Recall Aristotle:
    - Believed the heart was the first thing to come into existence when embryo is developing, and last that stops when you die
    - Malebranche would ask:
        - What good is a heart without the veins and arteries?
        - What good is it without nerves to make it move?
        - What is a heart going to do for you without all of the other parts that it serves?
- & Not only do all the parts fit together, but they depend for their existence on every other part

## Kant’s Critique of Mechanism

> [!info]+ Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) made a very similar argument, though *not* for preformationism
> - % Malebranche is 1638-1715
> - Kant is not arguing for preformationism, but identifies the same problem
>     - Kant might be the more famous version of identifying this problem

- Kant was on board with the idea that ==scientific explanations of material things should be mechanical==
- ! But also thought living things posed a particular *problem*
    - Hard to explain in mechanical terms
    - Thinks they are *impossible* to explain exclusively in mechanical terms

### The Unity of Organisms

- Kant observed, in all living things:
    - & The *parts* seem to serve the survival of the *whole*, and
    - & The *whole* produces the *parts*
- e.g., Why does a tree have leaves?
    - Because they want to do photosynthesis
    - Leaves are *for* gathering chemical energy for the survival of the tree
    - Tree produces the leaves
    - Tree produces just the kind of leaves that it needs to survive
        - According to its way of getting by in the world
    - & Parts and the wholes co-constitute
        - Leaves are constituted by the tree
        - Tree is constituted by the leaves
        - They depend mutually on each other
        - % This kind of circular philosophy was what the mechanical philosophy was trying to banish from our way of seeing things
            - Recall Hobbes’ critique of Aristotle:
                - Aristotelian essences give us this circular explanation
                - Why do things fall down? Because they have this essence that makes them want to return to their proper place in the Earth
                - Kind of like saying they fall down, because they fall down
                - Circular explanation
                    - Does not really get you under the surface of things
                - Therefore, we should just do *efficient causation*
                    - Efficient causes do not lead you to this illusion of explanation where you do not really have one
- Kant notes:
    - Living things have this character where the parts are constituted by the whole
    - If you want to understand the whole, then you have to understand the parts
    - If you want to understand the parts, then you have to understand the whole
    - $ Looks like the kind of question that requires some type of circular explanation
        - In this case: about the *final causes* — purposes or goals of the parts of the thing

> [!quote]+ Kant, 1790/2000, 5:360
> “nature, considered as a mere mechanism, could have formed itself in a thousand different ways without hitting precisely upon the unity in accordance with such a rule”

- A tree could have cactus spikes, little fingers instead of leaves, hair
    - We know all those things are mechanically possible
        - In the sense that there is no law of nature against their existence
    - ? Why did a tree come up with leaves?
        - Unless if you understand how a tree is supposed to get by in the world, it is a really weird coincidence that happen to be the perfect thing that keep the tree alive

### Hollow Bones

![](https://i.imgur.com/aTiPyaB.png)

- Kant makes the following argument:
    - If you look at the way we are built, it is all *contingent*
        - i.e., It could have been otherwise
    - Bones of (most) birds are much less dense than terrestrial animals
        - Practically hollow
        - ? Why would that be the case?
            - Looks **mechanically contingent**
            - Cannot say that it is because of mechanical necessity
                - Know that it is not; there are mechanisms that can perfectly produce non-hollow birds
                - Why do birds have hollow bones?
                - Birds fly; want to fly; how they get by in the world; one of the goals/things it is trying to do
                    - This is not a mechanistic explanation
                    - Explanation in terms of goals and purposes
                        - Exactly the kind of thing that mechanical philosophy said we are not allowed to use
                        - & So it is *mechanically contingent*
                            - % *Contingency* is the kind of thing you are trying to remove by explaining things mechanically
                            - “This looks like this could have been some other way to me”
                            - A good explanation will reduce the contingency of things
                                - “Here is why it had to be this way, or is likely to be this way”
- There does not seem to be a mechanical way of solving this
    - Forget about Darwin for a second
        - Not in this time period yet

### Newton of a Blade of Grass

- Kant:
    - & Believes only mechanical explanations are scientifically *valid*
    - ! But also thinks living things cannot be explained without **teleology**
    - & Therefore there cannot ever be a **==science of living things==**
        - Biology is impossible
        - There can never be a Newton of even a blade of grass

> [!info]+ Kant’s Critique of Mechanism
> - We do not need to go too deep into what Kant thought this demonstrates
>     - He uses it as one of his *antinomies*
>         - Arguments that are meant to show that we must conceptually distinguish the phenomena of experience from the noumena of reality itself
>     - % Not going to be on test
> - Main point for us:
>     - & This argument was still current a generation after Malebranche
>         - You cannot explain living things mechanically

## The Watchmaker

- The Watchmaker
    - Possibly the most famous use of this style of argument
    - By William Paley
    - Book (1802) arguing for the existence of God
        - 10-12 years after Kant was writing
- % Paley is trying to do rational theology
    - Trying to offer an argument for the existence of God

> [!abstract]+ The Watchmaker
> - Paley asks us to imagine walking along a beach and finding a watch
>     - Perfectly constructed such that it keeps good time
> - & One would naturally conclude that it had a *designer*
>     - Would not assume that watch was a natural phenomena; the sand must have swirled around just right so that a watch popped up
>     - Rather, someone made it, someone had a design in mind, and constructed this thing on purpose
>     - Then, when we think about us with our vastly more-intricate construction, we must have been designed

## Paley’s Argument from Design

> [!summary]+ Paley’s Argument from Design
> 1. Living things appear to have been designed
> 2. The only reasonable explanation of the appearance of design is a designer
> 3. Living things were intelligently designed

### 1. Living Things Appear to Have Been Designed

- Paley gives us a brief description of when things ‘appear to have been designed’
    - Gives us some criteria
    - Appearance of design could be deceptive
- ? What does it mean to say that something looks designed?
    - & The parts seem to *serve* a purpose
    - & If the parts were just a little different, they would not serve that purpose
- e.g., You go to a forest → lots of perfectly-good sticks to poke a fire
    - If they bent 15º further, they would still perfectly poke the fire
    - Can stir up a fire with most types of sticks
    - Small variations do not really make a difference to that functionality
    - Therefore, it is not reasonable to conclude that the stick is designed for poking fires
- Criteria for something ‘looking designed’:
    - Need to be something useful
    - Need to be something that if it were just a little bit different, it would not be useful

### 2. The Only Reasonable Explanation of the Appearance of Design is a Designer

- This is an inference to the best explanation
- **Inference to the best explanation**
    - We observe some phenomenon
    - Some hypothesis is the best explanation we can give of it
        - e.g., it must have been designed that way
    - Therefore, that hypothesis is likely to be true
- Problems with this approach:
    - What if there was an explanation you just did not think of?
        - The only way to explain the design of living things is to say that God did it
            - % Was 1802; has not thought about natural selection yet
- Sometimes, this approach works well
    - Deflection of light by gravity
        - Predicted by special relativity
        - One of the earliest demonstrations of special relatively was the observation of sunlight during an eclipse
        - Einstein predicts:
            - Light will be deflected by heavy objects
            - Because what gravity really is is the curve in space time
            - Newtonian mechanics does not predict that; just says light just goes
            - Einstein says that light will be deflected by heavy objects
            - Heaviest object we have around here is the sun
        - Pointed a telescope right beside the sun during an eclipse
            - Know where they should see the stars
            - Then sees them shifted exactly by the amount that Einstein predicted
        - & We observe that the stars look like they have been shifted
        - & Einstein’s theory of special relativity is the best explanation we can give for the shifting
        - & Therefore, Einstein’s theory of special relativity is probably true

### 3. Living Things Were Intelligently Designed

- If the first two premises are granted:
    - Hard to see how to deny the conclusion
- % Most people think 2. is wrong
    - Since Paley was writing shortly before Darwin’s theory of evolution was published

## The Origin of Species

> [!info]+ This style of argument lost steam after 1859
> - When Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection*

- % People did not leap on board with Darwin’s ideas right away
    - In fact:
        - A vigorous scientific debate persisted for another 100 years

### Orthogenesis

- Some early palaeontologists did not find Darwin’s picture convincing
    - Saw fossils
        - Seemed to show smooth, linear development across massive time-spans
            - e.g., looked like horse legs were just getting longer
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/TUjUmYB.png)
- Some preferred the idea of *orthogenesis*
- **Orthogenesis**
    - Idea that species change over time according to *internal principles*
    - “Ortho-”
        - Straight line
    - “-genesis”
        - Change in a species over time
- People different on which principles they thought those were
    - From an inner “perfecting principle”
    - To just small mechanical changes across generations
- People who looked at orthogenesis would respond to Darwin:
    - “Your thing about random variations being acted on by selection does not seem to explain the straight lines I am seeing in this fossil graphs”
        - Would be weird if it went on as a straight line for 55 million years
    - Palaeontologists thought that natural selection does not fit with how we think

### Inheritance

> [!important]+ Darwin’s theory of inheritance was also a bit of a problem
> - Darwin was a **pangenesist**
>     - Thought that tiny “gemmules” were collected from all over the body to transmit form to the next generation
>         - Answers the question: why do I look like my parents?
>         - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jmrAzWI.png)
>         - Allows for the inheritance of *acquired* characteristics
>             - e.g., if your parents are sporty and have big, strong bones, muscles, and ligaments, then you will get big, strong bones, muscles, and ligaments
>         - % There is not this crisp separation between the tissues of the body generally and what gets transmitted to the next generation

- August Weismann (1889)
    - Described testing this by cutting the tails off of five generations of mice
    - $ Each new generation of mouse had perfectly formed tails
        - Tails did not even get shorter
            - Maybe there are some tail gemmules carried over, and there are leftover tail information that will diminish over generations
            - But saw none of that
- % This is unsurprising to us
    - We subscribe to the idea that genetic material — the stuff that is inherited — is separate from the rest of your body
    - DNA is usually the thing that gets identified

### Blending Inheritance

- Darwin also subscribed to ‘**blending inheritance**’

![](https://i.imgur.com/RiDg1tA.png)

> [!def]+ Blending inheritance
> - Idea that for any given trait, children will be (on average) a *blend* between their two biological parents

> [!danger]+ Problem for a theory that says natural selection actions on *variation* in a population
> - If you keep blending inheritance in generations, that reduces the variation in further generations
> - i.e., If each next generation is an average of the previous, you very quickly destroy all variation in the population
>     - ! Then, there is nothing for natural selection to act on!

## Inheritance: Chromosomes

- **Chromosomes**
    - First observed and identified as a possible location for hereditary material in late 1800s and early 1900s
- Experiments on drosophila flies
    - & Allowed the very first rough mapping of where on a chromosome a given trait could be coded
        - i.e., where the genes are; where genetic material might reside
        - % They do not have an idea of what a gene is at this time
            - Just say maybe there is a gene for this trait
            - Gene is just a particular bit of genetic information
    - 1920-30s
- $ This is a version of inheritance that is *not* pangenesis
    - Chromosomes are tiny and just a couple
    - Are not migrating from every cell and collecting in reproductive organs
    - Are just chromosomes in the sperm and egg
        - That is where you get your genetic material
- Weismann barrier
    - Barrier between **germ plasm** — stuff that gets passed onto next generation — and rest of your body
