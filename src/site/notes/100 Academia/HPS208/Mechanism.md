# Mechanism

## Recap: How We Think about Life

### Review

We started from roughly this question:

> [!question]+ Which bits of the world is it okay to eat?
> - Looked briefly at [[100 Academia/HPS208/Hindu Environmental Ethics\|Hindu]], [[100 Academia/HPS208/Hindu Environmental Ethics#Ahimsa in Jainism\|Jain]], and [[100 Academia/HPS208/Animacy and Inanimacy\|Anishinaabe]] views on this
> - All three regard plants and animals as having *sentience*
> - All three attribute moral standing to plants and animals, and sometimes other parts of the world

- Talked about [[100 Academia/HPS208/Animal Sentience (ASENT)\|ASENT]] criteria for sentience
    - Which apply to living things with a *nervous system*
- Considered literature on [[100 Academia/HPS208/Plant Intelligence\|plant cognition]]
    - Where there is a debate about how intelligent they are
- Looked at [[100 Academia/HPS208/Strange Agents\|Levin and Baluska]]‘s argument
    - Cognition is extremely widespread (if we define *cognition* loosely enough)

### Looking Forward

For the next few weeks, we will be dealing with the issue of **mechanism**.

- A collection of ideas and ways of seeing the world that became common during the ‘scientific revolution’
    - In many ways, mechanism is the defining perspective for what you might call the modern scientific worldview
    - Or the “default” or received view

> [!summary]+ Mechanism
> - This week:
>     - Talk about its *origins*
> - Next two weeks:
>     - Talk about its *problems*
> - Afterwards:
>     - *Contemporary alternatives*
> - And then a week on *astrobiology* because it is neat

## Descartes (1596 - 1650)

> [!tldr]+ Anthropocentrism and its discontents: the moral status of animals in the history of Western philosophy (Steiner, 2010)
> - **Anthropocentrism**
>     - Human-centred way of seeing the world, taking ourselves to be the main characters of the universe
> - Chapter focused in on **==Rene Descartes==**
>     - Who was a *mechanist* about the material world
>         - Meaning he believes that everything can be explained in terms of the interactions of its smallest parts
>             - Little bits of matter bumping into each other
>         - & But he believes that human beings specifically have *immaterial souls*
>             - Which make us the ==only morally important living things==
>             - Human beings cannot be explained mechanistically
>             - Reserves this one single part of the universe as exempt from the mechanistic worldview: human minds

- Some mechanists argue that even humans can be explained mechanistically
- Descartes has an interesting position for understanding where we are now
    - He narrows down who and what matters to this pinpoint of the *human soul*
    - If you follow Descartes that far, and then give up on the idea that we have an immortal soul
    - → End up in a position thinking *nothing* and no one is morally relevant
        - This is the hazard
- He’s removed from every part of the world except our own minds anything you should bother caring about
    - Except in *instrumentalist* terms
    - e.g., Should care about not burning down your house, but not for your house’s sake; so you can have somewhere to live
- & The only thing intrinsically worth anything is humans because we have immortal souls
    - ! But Descartes’ account on immortal souls is famously on shaky philsophical grounds

## The Aristotelian Worldview

> [!note]+ Before we talk about **mechanism**, let’s step back and see what it is a response to.
> - The **Aristotelian** worldview

- Ancient Greek philosopher
- Aristotelian worldview is particularly relevant for us because:
    - Partly because of his historical relevance
    - But also to see what the mechanist worldview is *rejecting*
    - Descartes’ picture of the world is largely Christian in character
    - Christianity of this period is heavily influenced by Aristotle

![](https://i.imgur.com/KuiJjcM.png)

> [!summary]+ Aristotelian Worldview
> 1. **The theory of natural motions**
> 2. **The conformity theory**

### The Theory of Natural Motion

- Aristotelian physics has no math in it
    - There is math in the astronomy in the Aristotelian worldview
        - Stars, planets can be described mathematically
    - They do rough math to figure out the volume of a plot of land, etc.
    - But in the pure universal knowledge that is supposed to be physics, there is not really math
- Instead:
    - There is a view of a five-element system and an understanding of how those elements interact with each other
        - Earth
        - Air
        - Fire
        - Water
        - Quintessance
            - Only the stars are made of quintessance
            - Unchanging, perfect fifth element

<!-- break -->
- & Everything has an **essence**
- & Its essence defines its **purpose**
    - Purpose is to find its proper place in the universe
- & Things move according to their purposes

<!-- break -->
- ? Why do rocks sink in water?
    - Because the rocks proper place in the universe is in the middle — at the bottom
    - That is where it longs to return to
    - Can impart violent motion to something by throwing rock in air, but its natural motion will quickly take hold and bring it back to where it belongs
- Similarly, air will rise above water
- Fire will rise about air
    - Part of fire’s essence is to return to its natural place in the universe above the air
- & Things according to their essences want to return to their natural place in the universe

### Four ‘Causes’

If you are going to explain or understand anything, according to Aristotle, you should do it in *four* ways.

- Four ways of explaining our understanding of any given thing:
    - The **material**,
    - The **efficient**,
    - The **formal**, and
    - The **final**

> [!question]+ Why is this vase the way that it is?
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/5KyL1RH.png)
>
> - Material explanation:
>     - It is made of clay
>     - & Understand why it is the way that it is by understanding the stuff that it is made from
>         - The matter
> - Efficient cause:
>     - & The physical pushing, pulling story of its origins and history
>     - Well, somebody sat down and shaped it with a pottery wheel, and added handles to it
> - Formal cause:
>     - Vase has a *form* and *shape*
>     - Person who pushed and pulled the material into that shape was doing it order to cause it to be in the shape of a vase
>     - It is the way it is because it is supposed to be a vase
>         - Supposed to have space in the middle
>         - Hold water, oil, or stuff like that
> - Final cause:
>     - & A *purpose* or a *telos*
>         - A use, got something that it is for
>     - Vase is for holding things or decorative

- If you want to understand anything, you should probably understand it in all four of those ways
    - According to Aristotle
- For us, things have purposes when we decide they have purposes
    - Or maybe have purpose of being apart of a living thing
        - e.g., Hands are for grasping, heart is for pumping blood
    - When we start talking about the purpose of a frog
        - Not defined by its purposes
        - Just a thing that happens
    - Rocks, water?
- Aristotelian worldview:
    - Taking the ways you have of understanding yourself and people you relate with and living world
    - Applying them to everything in the universe
    - Treats the world as full of meaning, purpose, goals, essences, proper places
        - Taking common sense — developed on understanding yourself and social relationships — and applying it to the universe
        - e.g., I have goals, so the universe has goals
    - Notice this cosmologically:
        - “I feel like I am the center of the universe”
        - → Humans are in the center of things
    - Taking common sense and turning it into a picture of the universe

### The Conformity Theory

> [!question]+ How do we understand the universe? How do we gain knowledge of things?

- **Eides**
    - Translated usually as *form*
    - Exist both in objects and in our minds
    - e.g., There is a form of a chair
        - Understand it by seeing it under normal conditions
        - See a bunch of chairs
        - Get the form of the chair in your mind
        - Form is both *in* the char and in your *mind*
    - & Physical things are composed of the combination of *matter* and *form*
        - Matter is this fundamentally unstructured stuff
        - Need the combination of material and form to make anything up
        - Form in the chair is literally just also in your mind
            - Not like you have an image or representation of a chair
    - You directly know the structure of things (for Aristotle)
- & We are in direct contact with reality
    - You do not make guesses, infer
    - Just see things and make the form in your own mind
- We do not generally get to think of ourselves as in direct contact with the universe
    - Such that we can see everything’s place and purpose
    - Have it all be in terms that are super familiar in our own day-to-day lives

### Aristotle’s Three Souls

![](https://i.imgur.com/fZWQWB2.png)

- Aristotle:
    - Humans have **three souls**
    - & **Soul** is the *form* of the *body*
        - Forms do not get to exist without the *matter*
        - & Soul is *material*
            - But only in the same way that the shape of a chair is different from the stuff it is made from
- Plants have one *nutritive* soul
    - Structural, functional relationships that lets them grow and reproduce
- Animals have two souls
    - Nutritive and *instinctive* soul
    - Lets them move around and respond to things in behavioural ways
- Humans have a *rational* soul
- % Plato (Aristotle’s teacher) thought that the forms of things could exist *independently* of any material and instantiation
    - Before you were born, you knew the form of the triangle
    - Perfect essence of this triangle-ness
    - Aristotle disagrees
        - ! Forms can only exist when realized in some kind of material thing
        - Matter needs form, form needs matter
- *Soul* is a bit misleading
    - Probably thinking implicitly/intuitively the Cartesian notion of the soul
        - Something that survives after the destruction of your body
    - Aristotle:
        - Soul is the shape or form or set of relationships that makes the body what it is
        - In humans: all three
            - Ability to grow and reproduce
            - Ability to move around in an instinctual way
            - Ability to reason
        - Not independent of the body
        - Realized through the material of the body

> [!question]+ Who is it okay to eat?
> - There is a clear hierarchy here
>     - Determining the degree of moral consideration a living thing deserves
> - Aristotle is perfectly fine with eating animals
>     - Humans are a superior kind of beings to animal because we have an extra *soul*
>         - We have the *rational* soul, and animals simply do not
>         - Extra okay to eat plants, because they do not even have the instinctive soul
> - $ Moral hierarchy
>     - Will see this same moral hierarchy when talking about **mechanism**

> [!note]+ When we get to *mechanism*, we will see a change in the *metaphysical background theory*
> - But the retention of the hierarchy

## Monotheisms

- To get from Aristotle to Descartes
    - Will take a look at Christianity
- To get to Christianity:
    - Talk about Judaism

### Hierarchy, Kinship, and Responsibility

> [!tldr]+ Kalechofsky (2006)
> - Describes the Jewish relation to animals as *hierarchical*
>     - With humans on top
> - Also one that is supposed to include a feeling of *kinship* and *kindness*
>     - Old nuclear family:
>         - Dad is hierarchically above the rest of the family
>             - Decides what happens and who does what
>         - Nonetheless obliged to treat everybody sort of nicely
> - There is a hierarchy in Judaism, but also a *responsibility*
> - One strain of interpretation:
>     - Suggests that God commanded Adam and Eve to only eat plants in Eden
>     - Only gave permission for meat eating after the flood
> - & Explains that there is a great big long debate about *vegetarianism* in Judaism
>     - At least one interpretive tradition in Judaism that regards vegetarianism as a spiritual ideal
>         - As we perfect ourselves and become better people and more aligned with the intentions of God
>         - Returning to the state we were in in the Garden of Eden where we only ate plants
>     - Partly idea was to treat animals kindly
>         - But also to act in a restrained and chaste manner
>         - Not greedy and lustful
>             - e.g., “I really want a burger”

### Christianity and Animals

> [!note]+ Similar debates can be found within Christianity
> - Though the New Testament seems fairly clear that eating meat is generally okay

> “One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.”
> (Romans 14:2)

- If you are strong in faith:
    - Go ahead and eat meat
- If you are shaky:
    - Maybe only eat vegetables

> “Eat anything sold in the meat market.”
> (1 Corinthians 10:25)

- An endorsement of eating meat
- First tradition like this that we have seen so far
    - Not so much like: eat meat if you develop a communion with it and gets it consent
    - More like: go ahead and eat meat

### Aristotle in the Islamic World

![|400](https://i.imgur.com/I5ed88V.png)

- While Western Europe is falling to bits:
    - A series of *Caliphates* are growing
        - On the other side of the Mediterranean
- Translation Movement
    - The Abbasid Caliphate
        - Spent a lot of money to collect and translate books
        - Including works by Aristotle
- & A great deal of new science and philosophy is done in this period

#### Al-Ghazali (1058-1111)

- In this period:
    - First cracks start to appear in the Aristotelian worldview
    - Aristotle is part of this and a big deal for science, philosophy in the Islamic world
    - But it is not easy to reconcile Aristotle with Islam
        - Not straightforward
- Two broad traditions interacting with each other:
    - **Falsafa**
        - Philosophy
    - **Kalam**
        - Rational interpretation of Islam
        - Theology
        - What kind of arguments and evidence can we marshal for the Islamic fate?
- **Al-Ghazali**
    - Tied in the middle of these things
    - Studies philosophy and theology
    - Gets messed up by Aristotle
        - Goes through this crisis of skepticism
        - When you ask yourself what is the real evidence you have for your beliefs, can sometimes fall out from under you
        - This happens to Al-Ghazali
    - Engaged with Aristotelian tradition
        - Supposed to have direct, certain knowledge of really deep parts of the world
        - According to Aristotle: Supposed to have clear, deductive arguments of your beliefs based on certain knowledge of the essences of things
        - We do not really have that
            - If you follow the history of philosophy
        - We have rough guesses of what things seem like for us
            - Evidence, but not *certainty*
- Certainty turns out to be much harder to come by than Aristotle thought it was
    - This wounds Al-Ghazali for a while, then he finds his faith in Islam renewed
- Writes “*The Incoherence of the Philosophers*”
    - Questions the Aristotelian idea that causal relations are necessary
    - ? If you do not have a way of understanding the essences of things, then how do you know there are essence of things?
        - Cracks that widen and become the downfall of the worldview
- Argument:
    - For Aristotle:
        - Causal relations
        - e.g., If you put fire to dry cotton, it will burn
            - That fire *causes* the cotton to be consumed
        - Causal relation is necessary
        - Because it is in the essence of fire and cotton that this should happen
        - You just see it happening
    - Al-Ghazali:
        - Says: “Can you?”
            - Can you see the cause?
            - Can you see the necessity
        - When you interrogate your senses, what you see is one thing happening, and then another thing happening
            - Not one thing necessarily causing another thing

#### Islam and Animals

> “According to Islamic teachings, animals have specific position and purpose in the creation hierarchy. Fundamentally they have been created to fulfil the multiple needs of the mankind. On the other hand humans have been directed not to waste the lives of animals and are held responsible for their well-being and feed.”
> (Awan & Rahim, 2018)

- Humans are top of the food chain for things on Earth
- Supposed to be kind to animals
    - Morally virtuous to be nice to animals
- But they are there for us
- Islam:
    - Number of cruel practices are forbidden
        - Including using animals as target practice, making them fight each other for sport, beating them on the face, etc.
    - *Halal* practices are intended to *reduce cruelty* in the slaughter of animals for food
- Nonetheless:
    - Animals are there for us
    - Should be able to eat them
    - Should not want to kill them, but do eat them if you need to

### Great Chain of Being

> [!info]+ Christian Europe also had a clearly *hierarchical* picture of our relationship with the natural world.
> - **Great Chain of Being**

- **Great Chain of Being**
    - ==God== is on top
    - ==Angels== are right below
        - Composed of spirit and unchangeable
        - There are hierarchies of angels as well
    - ==Humans==
        - Have both spirit and matter
    - ==Animals==
    - ==Plants==
    - ==Minerals==
        - Which are just matter
- & Each level has moral *priority*
    - Over the level below it
- Was understood both as a *metaphysical* hierarchy
    - And as a *social/political* one
    - Not just where you are, but describes your proper place in the universe
- Kings and Queens are close to God than the peasants
    - Serving nobility is our proper place in the universe
- Metaphysical picture of why social mobility is bad
    - Nobility by birth
    - Nobility because God made you there
    - Staying in your lane is how you honour the natural structure of reality

### The Heavenly Spheres

![](https://i.imgur.com/YoaPXJS.png)

- This hierarchy was reflected in the structure of the universe itself
- ==Unchanging stars== above all
    - Composed of quintessence
- Below them: the ==wandering stars==
- Below it all: ==Earth==
    - Where all the elements are mixed up and changing

## A Transitional Period in Europe

- 14th century was not awesome for Europe
    - Bubonic plague killed ⅓ of the population
    - 100 years war ran from 1337 to 1453
    - Catholic church schisms in 1378
        - Protestantism vs. Catholicism
- What was seemingly fixed and eternal is no longer
    - Peasants seemed to be able to move to other places for a better life
    - Colonialist project of Europe kicked off too
    - Trade becomes much more important
    - People are no longer settled in the way it was before this

## Copernicus (1473-1543)

- & Needed really good maps and star maps in order to travel
    - → Astronomy became important
- **Copernicus**
    - Rewrites the picture of the cosmos
    - Using newly imported math
    - % Was not the first to suggest that the Earth moves
        - Aryabhata (476-550) argued this some time ago

## Galileo and Math

- **Galileo**
    - Starts using mathematics do to terrestrial physics
    - Aristotle's physics had no math whatsoever
        - Believed that the earthly world was too much of a mess for math to apply
- Not yet at the point where we are creating clear quantitative measures of motion
    - But getting there

### Primary and Secondary Qualities

- **Primary qualities**
    - Those that would still be there without any observer
    - e.g., Piece of chalk has weight
        - Can feel the heaviness, but it is still there whether holding it or not
        - Has shape, extension, width, length
- **Secondary qualities**
    - Those that require someone to experience them
        - e.g., Chalk is *white*
            - Whiteness is perceived
    - Colour, smell, sound
        - Need someone to be there for them to be present
- Aristotle thought a whole bunch of our experience was present in the world
    - Experience things as having purposes, goals, colour, etc.
    - Maybe they do not
    - Maybe the smell is something in your mind, rather than the world

## Mechanical Worldview

- The stripping away of things we thought were maybe in our world to maybe just our senses
    - → Comes ahead in the mechanical worldview/philosophy
    - Philosophy of the scientific revolution
- & Scientific revolution introduces the idea that the world is just **mechanical**
    - It has no purposes in it; no meaning
        - Purpose is a thing a person can have, but nothing in the world has purpose
    - Our *minds* are the only place those things live
- & The world has *shape* and *extension*

## Mere Extension

## Key Terms

### Mechanism

### Cartesian Dualism

### Great Chain of Being
