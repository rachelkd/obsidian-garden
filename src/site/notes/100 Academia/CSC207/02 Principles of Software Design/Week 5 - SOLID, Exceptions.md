> [!question]- Questions to be answered this week:
> Software Design Decisions
> 
> 1. Give an example of a “design decision” that you might make when developing a class.
> 2. Give an example of a “design decision” that you might make when reading a specification and using it to develop a plan for your program.
> 
> SOLID Principles of Design
> 
> 1. What is the difference between a rule and a principle?  
> Why do we have principles of software design instead of rules?
> 
> 2. For each SOLID principle, state the principle and include a brief description of the example so that you can refer to it later when studying for the exam:
> 
>    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
> SRP Example --
> 
>    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
> OCP Example --
> 
>    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
> LSP Example --
> 
>    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
> ISP Example --
> 
>    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
> DIP Example --
> 
> 3. What does “encapsulation” mean? Which of the SOLID principles are related to encapsulation?
> 4. What does “High cohesion, loose coupling” mean? Which of the SOLID principles explicitly agree with this statement?
> 5. We have seen many features of Java that agree with the SOLID principles. Describe five features, one for each SOLID principle that agrees with the principle.
> 
> Exceptions
> 
> 1. What is an Exception in Java?
> 2. What is the conceptual difference between a “checked” and “unchecked” Exception?
> 3. What is the syntactical (syntax) difference between a “checked” and “unchecked” Exception?
> 4. Why do we leave RuntimeExceptions unchecked?
> 5. Why should we not include as many checked Exceptions as possible in our code?
> 6. When should we catch each exception?
> 7. What is the purpose of a “finally” block?
