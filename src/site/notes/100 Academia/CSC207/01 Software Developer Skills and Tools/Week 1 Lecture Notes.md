# Software Development Life Cycle

> [!question]+ Questions to be answered this week:

# Java

> [!question]+ Questions to be answered this week:
> - What is the structure of a Java class? (declaration, variables, ...)
> - What are the possible accessibility modifiers and primitive types in Java?
> - What is the difference between the equals method and the `==` operator?
> - All Java classes are subclasses of "Object". We call Java classes "reference types" as opposed to "primitive types". What is the difference between the two?
> - How is a constructor different from a method? Include information about what each does as well as the difference in syntax.
