> [!summary]+ Some common and more complex structures
> - Multiplexer
> - Decoders
>     - e.g., Seven-segment decoders
> - Adders (half and full)
> - Subtractors
> - Comparators

- These are all **combinational circuits**
    - Some boolean combination of the inputs
    - Can make a boolean logical expression that takes the inputs and makes a *single* output

> [!def]+ Combinational circuit
> - Any circuit where the outputs rely strictly on the inputs
>     - Everything that we have done so far is all combinational logic
