# Circuit Creation

> [!goal]+ Learning Objectives
> - Create a truth tables or Boolean equations that represents the behaviour of a circuit you want to create.  
> - Sketch the schematic of a combinational circuit from a specification.
> - Translate the rows in a circuit’s truth table into gates that implement that circuit.  
> - Know about minterms and maxterms.
> - Use Karnaugh maps to reduce the circuit to the minimal number of gates.

> [!tldr]+ Readings
> - Sections 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, p35-72   (Mano & Kime)
