- When is a **barplot** used?
	- Visualize the distribution of a *categorical variable* with two or more categories
- There is one **bar** for each **category**/value
- The order of the bars is arbitrary
- The height of the bar counts the *number of observations* for each category
- Bars have arbitrary widths (but should all be the same)
- There is a gap between each bar (gaps should be the same width)
	- indicates that this is not a continuous axis
	- These are different values that can be in any order

# Describing the distribution of a categorical variable

- Which category is the **most common**?
	- Washed
- **Least common**?
	- Pulped natural
- **How many times more common** is one category than another?
	- Washed is ~3 times as common as natural
- Does it make sense to talk about the shape or centre of this barplot?
	- No, because these are arbitrary labels

# Creating a barplot in R

```r
ggplot(data = coffee_ratings, aes(x = processing_method)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black",
                 fill = "gray") +
  labs(x = "Processing method")
  # + coord_flip()  # to flip plot
```

- Same as for `geom_histogram()` but with a categorical variable

# Looking at the association between two categorical variables
