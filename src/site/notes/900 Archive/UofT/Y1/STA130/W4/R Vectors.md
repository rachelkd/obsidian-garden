Variables with the same type can be combined together into **vectors**.

- What is a **vector**?
	- basic data structure that represents a one-dimensional array
	- contains elements of the same type

```r
die <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
die
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

```r
is.vector(die)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
length(die)
```

```
## [1] 6
```
