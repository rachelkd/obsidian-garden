# Philosophy of science

- This is going to be the most philosophy filled week
    - Requires looking into arguments that may at first seem completely obvious

# Realism and Anti-Realism

- Should we believe our best scientific theories are true?
- Is the job of a scientific theory to be true?
- Do electrons exist?

Science captures something true about the world $\rightarrow$ why it works really well

Anti-realism is *not* talking about people who think that science does not work (making good predictions, enabling us to make good technology)

# Empirical adequacy

- empirical
    - sense, observations

**Example of empirical adequacy:** 

- People often thought that the sun revolves around the Earth
    - That theory was wrong!
    - It’s wrong but it makes the right predictions

When a theory is empirically adequate, it means that the **theory makes the right predictions**.

- Incorrect theories (like a geocentric model of the solar system) can make good predictions

Is the job of science is to be more than empirical adequacy?

# A proposal for modesty

## Anti-realists

Anti-realists don’t want to commit to more than they need to.

- Anti-realists say: our theories make good predictions
	- “Why did you have to say the second part about being true?”
- “You’re committing too much. Our theories make good predictions.”
- <mark style="background: #776F33A6;">The observations are your only access to the truth and falsity of these theories</mark>
- Anti-realist thinks realists are ***over-committing***

Some call themselves *instrumentalists*; the point of science is to be useful. That’s all it does, and that is all you can prove it does.

The truth bit? I don’t know about that. Are there really electrons? I don’t know, but the theory seems to be doing well right now.

## Realists

Realists say:

- our theories make good predictions, and they’re (mostly) true

# Empiricism

- The justification of all our beliefs come from our senses
- Anti-realist thought follows in the tradition of empiricists like David Hume:
    - If you have ideas about the world, they had better be justified by something you can observe
- Logical deductions are fine, but in a sense, they’re just playing with the definitions you have in your head, which you acquired by observation

This rejects believing in metaphysical truths beyond what our senses can tell us

- Philosophers had long believed in things like essences, purposes, causes, and so on
- Hume thought these ideas were only worthwhile insofar as you could cache them out in *observations*

# Idealized Models

- One reason to be an anti-realist is that you have some idea of how science works.

Another reason to be skeptical that our best scientific theories are true is how common it is to have simplified or idealized models:

- Scientists assume frictionless planes, infinite populations mating at random, and perfectly rigid pendula in order to simplify things
    - Doesn’t that mean we know there is quite a bit of untruth in our theories?

# Approximate Truth

The counterargument from the realist side is:

- Ok, we do make a lot of simplifying assumptions
    - But that doesn’t make those models simply false
- **Theories are approximately true**, or partially true, or something like that

So, good enough $\rightarrow$ empirically adequate, and

true enough $\rightarrow$ approximate truth

# No Miracles Argument

An important response from the realist is the No Miracles argument, usually attributed to **Hilary Putnam**. 

- If science just happened to keep getting the right answers, over and over again, but was mostly false, it would be a *miracle*.
- It is so unlikely that this would happen:
    - The best explanation for the success of science is that it is at least approximately true.

> [!note] Newton was not proven wrong and his theory was then useless after.
> - Newton’s theory turns out to be structrually speaking wrong, but it is an approximation to truth.
> - As far as anybody can tell, it can be recovered as a limited case of relativity and quantum mechanics
> 
> Newton gave us an approximate truth about reality.


The basic outlines of modern science is that it is unlikely that the theories are going to be flatly and obviously wrong; they are going to have some piece of truth in them.

Putnam is saying that science is producing approximate truths.

- This argument is telling the anti-realists they have reason to believe in these theories (more than just making good predictions)
    - It must have some truth to be making correct predictions.

# Response to No Miracles

The rejoinder to No Miracles from the anti-realists is to point out that actually, seemingly successful scientific theories have often proven to be wrong

- e.g., the wave theory of light
    - lots of good predictions, but the fundamental stuff (aether) it assumed, did not exist

# Observable/Unobservable Distinction

- Anti-realist skepticism about scientific entities only applies to unobservable entities
    - No one thinks maybe clouds, trees, rivers, etc. do not exist
    - Biology — some of that is unobservable (e.g., DNA). We mostly infer that it exists.

So, what is observable?

# Unobservable Entities

It is tempting to say that we can observe some sub-atomic particles

- In a cloud chamber, you can see little traces of radioactive particles zipping around
    - But is this really *observing* the particles?

Maybe, we should say we detect these particles, but we do not observe them.

- Realists argue: It’s a pretty vague line between “observable” and “unobservable”
    - Seeing something with your eyes is observation,
    - But how about through a window? Through glasses? A low powered telescope/microscope? Is the data that Hubble is sending over an observation?

Where is the cut-off for what counts as observable?

> [!note] Anti-realism is skepticism about unobservable entities in scientific theories.
> - Everyone in this discussion believes that science makes good predictions.

# Vague Terms

Anti-realists can reply:

- Sure, “observable” is a vague term.
    - But we use vague terms all the time!
- Just because there is no crisp distinction between “bald” and “not-bald” (e.g., “lose one more hair and you are bald”) does not mean there is no difference between the two; does not mean “bald” is meaningless.
- You can extract DNA into a goo; you cannot see the structure, but you can see DNA.
    - So, is it somewhere in-between observable and unobservable?
    - There is a degree of belief to a thing corresponding with its degree of observability.

# Underdetermination

One last argument from the anti-realists:

- They are scientific theories are ***underdetermined*** by their evidence
    - Many different theories could account for the same evidence
        - e.g., several different lines of best-fit for data
- Given that you cannot decide between those theories based on the observations or assumption that they all account for the observations, that means you shouldn’t believe the theoretical observation of any of those theories because they’re undetermined by the evidence

# Examples of Underdetermination

1. Copernicus published his model of the solar system
    - Didn’t do all that much better at making predictions than the older Ptolemaic model
        - His predictions were all the same; math was a bit simpler
    - People’s reactions show this:
        - They said: “Fine, that’s an okay model for doing calculations so long as you don’t say it’s what things are really like”
2. Various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics
    - Copenhagen interpretation
        - Light starts off as a wave until you observe it
        - When it bounces off (and somebody sees it), it collapses into a particle
    - “Many worlds” interpretation
        - Everything starts off as a particle moving around
        - When you observe something, the outcomes are sort of random. Everything that could happen in that distribution *does* happen in separate universes.
        - Wave function never collapses, just constantly branching
    - Theres a third: Bohemian mechanics
        - Particles always have a definite position and momentum
        - It’s just that they’re guided by a wave
        - There’s a wave that sort of guides the movement of particles
    - These are all ways to read the mathematics in Quantum Mechanics.
        - All three of these interpretations make the exact same predictions about the particles.
        - There is no observation to distinguish these.
    
	> [!note]
	> All of them make the same predictions. All of them predict the same observations.


# Realism and Anti-Realism about X

- You don’t have to be an anti-realist or realist about everything.
    - You can pick and choose:
        - e.g., “I’m pretty sure there are electrons; quarks — I don’t know”
        - You spray electrons at objects, and we know enough about them to tell how the way they bounce off those objects (electron microscopes)
            - Once you use electrons to do actual stuff, it can warrant your belief in them
            - Practical integration in our actual practices is what warrants believing in a thing
                - You can’t spray dark matter.
- Case-by-case is one way of sorting this debate out.

# Post-modern anti-realism

- A strain of anti-realism about science is the kind of cultural critique levelled (mostly in the 1990s) by post-modernists
    - What if science only looks like it works because it is judged by the standards set by hegemonic western power structures?
- That is wrong (according to Prof.)
    - Science is not a product of the west. It is a product of the whole world.

Which is why next time we will be talking about [[900 Archive/UofT/Y1/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/06 Global history of science\|Global history of science]].
