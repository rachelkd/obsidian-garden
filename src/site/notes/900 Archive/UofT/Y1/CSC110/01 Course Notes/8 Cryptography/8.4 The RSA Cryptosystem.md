# Introduction

- One limitation of symmetric-key cryptosystems
	- Shared key needs to be established for every pair of people who want to communicate
	- If there are $n$ people who each want to communicate securely with each other, they need ... keys
		- $\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$
		- First person needs $n - 1$ secret keys to communicate with everyone else
		- Second needs $n - 2$ secret keys
		- Third needs $n - 3$ secret keys
		  $$(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

- public-key cryptosystem
	- Form of cryptosystem
	- Each person has two keys:
		- Private key known only to them
		- Public key known to everyone
- symmetric-key cryptosystem
	- Messages are encrypted and decrypted with the same key

# Public-key cryptography

---

In ***public-key cryptography***, each party generations a *pair* of keys:
1. a *private* key (or secret key)
2. a *public* key (known to everyone)

Bob wants to send Alice a message:
- Uses Alice's public key to *encrypt* message $\rightarrow$ sends to Alice
- Alice uses own private key to *decrypt* the ciphertext
Alice wants to send Bob a message:
- Uses Bob's public key to *encrypt*
- Bob uses own private key to *decrypt*

<br>

- We define a ***secure public-key cryptosystem*** as a system with the following parts
	- A set $\mathcal{P}$ of possible original messages called **plaintext** messages
		- e.g., set of strings
	- A set $\mathcal{C}$ of possible encrypted messages called **ciphertext** messages
		- e.g., set of strings
	- A set $\mathcal{K}_{1}$ of possible public keys AND a set $\mathcal{K}_{2}$ of possible private keys
	- A subset $\mathcal{K} \subseteq \mathcal{K}_{1} \times \mathcal{K}_{2}$ of possible **public-private key pairs**
		- Not every public key can be paired with every private key
	- Two functions: $Encrypt : \mathcal{K}_{1} \times \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ and $Decrypt : \mathcal{K}_{2} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}$ that satisfy:
		- (*correctness*)
			- For all $(k_{1}, k_{2}) \in \mathcal{K}$ and $m \in \mathcal{P}$, $Decrypt(k_{2}, Encrypt(k_{1}, m)) = m$.
				- If you encrypt and then decrypt the same message with a public-private key pair, you get back the original message
		- (*security*)
			- For all $(k_{1}, k_{2}) \in \mathcal{K}$ and $m \in \mathcal{P}$, if an eavesdropper only knows the values of the public key $k_{1}$ and the ciphertext $c = Encrypt(k_{1}, m)$ but does not know $k_{2}$, it is *computationally infeasible* to find the plaintext $m$.

# The RSA Cryptosystem

---

- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem relies on...
	- hardness of factoring large integers

## Phase 1: Key generation

Each person must first generate a public-private key pair before communication
- Choosing a valid key-pair from set $\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{K}_{1} \times \mathcal{K}_{2}$
<br>
1.  Alice picks two distinct prime numbers $p$ and $q$
2. Alice computes product $n = pq$
3. Alice chooses an integer $e \in \{2,3, ..., \varphi(n) - 1\}$ such that $\text{gcd}(e, \varphi(n)) = 1$.
	1. From [[900 Archive/UofT/Y1/CSC110/01 Course Notes/7 Number Theory/7.5 Modular Exponentiation and Order\|7.5 Modular Exponentiation and Order]], $\varphi(n)$ is the number of positive integers $< n$ that are coprime to $n$.
4. Alice chooses an integer $d \in \{2,3,...,\varphi(n) - 1\}$ that is the modular inverse of $e$ modulo $\varphi(n)$
	1. $d e \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$
<br>
- Alice's private key is:
	- $(p, q, d)$
- Alice's public key is:
	- $(n, e)$

## Phase 2: Message encryption

Bob wants to send Alice a plaintext message $m$.
- Treat message as number between $1$ and $n - 1$
- Bob computes ciphertext $c = m^{e} \;\%\; n$, and sends it to Alice

## Phase 3: Message decryption

- Alice received ciphertext $c$
- Uses her private key $(p, q, d)$ to decrypt
	- Alice computes $m' = c^{d} \;\%\; n$

## An example

1. Alice generates a public and private key
	1. Chooses $p = 23, q = 31$
2. Computes $n = pq = 23 \cdot 31 = 713$
3. Alice chooses $e$ where $\text{gcd}(e, \varphi(n)) = 1$
	1. Calculates $\varphi(713) = 660$
	2. Chooses $e = 547$
4. Alice calculates the modular inverse to find $d$
	1. $d \cdot 547 \equiv 1 \pmod{660}$
	2. $d = 403$

At the end of this phase:
- Private key is $(p = 23, q = 31, d = 403)$
- Public key is $(n = 713, e = 547)$

Suppose Bob wants to send $m = 42$ to Alice
- He sends $c = 42^{e} \;\%\; n = 42^{547} \;\%\; 713 = 106$ to Alice
- Alice receives $106$ from Bob
- Alice computes $m = 106^{d} \;\%\; 713 = 106^{403} \;\%\; 713 = 42$

# Proving the correctness of RSA

---

**Theorem.**
Let $(p,q,d) \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \times \mathbb{Z}^{+} \times \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ be a private key and
$(n, e) \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \times \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ its corresponding public key.
Let $m, c, m' \in \{1, ..., n-1\}$ be the original plaintext message, ciphertext, and decrypted message.
Then, $m' = m$.

*Proof.*
Let $p, q, n, d, e, m, c, m' \in \mathbb{N}$ be defined as in the above definition of the RSA algorithm. We need to prove that $m' = m$.
Assume $\text{gcd}(m, n) = 1$. (For the sake of this proof)

From the definition of $m'$ in the decryption step, we know $m' \equiv c^{d} \pmod{n}$.
$$m' \equiv (m^{e})^{d} \equiv m^{ed} \pmod{n}$$
We need to show that $m^{ed} \equiv m \pmod{n}$.
We know that $d e \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$, i.e., there exists a $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $d e = k \cdot \varphi(n) + 1$.
We also know that since $\text{gcd}(m, n) = 1$, by [[900 Archive/UofT/Y1/CSC110/01 Course Notes/7 Number Theory/7.5 Modular Exponentiation and Order#Euler's Theorem\|Euler's Theorem]] $m^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.
Thus,
$$\begin{align*}
m' &\equiv m^{ed} && \pmod{n} \\
&\equiv m^{k \times \varphi(n) + 1} && \pmod{n} \\
&\equiv (m^{\varphi(n)})^{k} \times m && \pmod{n} \\
&\equiv 1^{k} \times m && \pmod{n} && \text{(by Euler's Theorem)} \\
&\equiv m && \pmod{n}
\end{align*}$$
So, $m' = m \pmod{n}$. Since we also know $m$ and $m'$ are between 1 and $n - 1$, we can conclude that $m' = m$.

# The security of RSA

---

Eavesdropper knows the:
1. ciphertext
2. public key $(n, e)$

**Approach 1: Reverse-engineering the message itself**
We know that $c \equiv m^{e} \pmod{n}$. It is computationally infeasible to find $m$ (discrete logarithm problem).

**Approach 2: Determine private key from public key**
Recall $d e \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$. We can compute *modular inverses*, BUT we need to know $\varphi(n)$. We only know $n$ from the public key.
- Eavesdropper does not know $p$ and $q$ such that $\varphi(n) = (p - 1) (q - 1)$
- It is *computationally infeasible* to factor $n$ when it is extremely large
- This is the ***Integer Factorization Problem***
	- There is no efficient algorithm for factoring integers
	- This keeps private key $(p, q, d)$ secure.

## Encryption and Decryption

**Encryption key: $(14, 5)$**
- Plaintext: $B \rightarrow 2$
- To encrypt, calculate $2^{5} \;\%\; 14 = 4$
- Ciphertext: $4 \rightarrow D$

**Decryption key: $(14, 11)$**
$4^{11} \;\%\; 14 = 2$

## Generating the Keys

How does this work?
1. Pick two prime numbers $p$ and $q$
	- $p = 2, q = 7$
2. $n = pq = 14$
3. $\varphi (n) = \varphi (14) = (p-1)(q-1) = 6$
	- See [[900 Archive/UofT/Y1/CSC110/01 Course Notes/7 Number Theory/7.5 Modular Exponentiation and Order#Euler's Theorem\|Euler's totient function]]
4. Choose $\begin{align} e \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 1 < e < \varphi(n)\\ \text{coprime with } n, \varphi(n) \end{array} \right. \end{align}$
	- $\not{2}, \not{3}, \not{4}, 5$
	- $e = 5$
5. Encryption key (lock): $(n, e) = (14, 5)$
6. Choose $d \; s.t. \; d e \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$
	- $5d \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$
	- Multiples of 5: $5, 10, 15, 20, 25$
	- Modulo 6: $5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0$
		- Every 6th multiple is $0 \mod{6}$
	- $d = 11$ ($d$ can also be $5$)
7. Decryption key: $(n, d) = (14, 11)$
