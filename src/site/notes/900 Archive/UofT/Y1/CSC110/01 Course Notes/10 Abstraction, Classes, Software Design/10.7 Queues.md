# The Queue ADT

- Queue
	- collection of data
	- adds and removes items in a fixed order
	- contr. to [[10.5 Stacks|stacks]], queues are *first-in-first-out* (**FIFO**)
- Data:
	- collection of items
- Operations:
	- determine whether the queue is empty
	- add an item (*enqueue*)
	- remove the least recently-added item (*dequeue*)

## Public interface of a `Queue` class

```python
from typing import Any


class Queue:
    """A first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of items.

    Stores data in a first-in, first-out order. When removing an item from the
    queue, the most recently-added item is the one that is removed.

    >>> q = Queue()
    >>> q.is_empty()
    True
    >>> q.enqueue('hello')
    >>> q.is_empty()
    False
    >>> q.enqueue('goodbye')
    >>> q.dequeue()
    'hello'
    >>> q.dequeue()
    'goodbye'
    >>> q.is_empty()
    True
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new empty queue."""

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this queue contains no items.
        """

    def enqueue(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add <item> to the back of this queue.
        """

    def dequeue(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the item at the front of this queue.

        Raise an EmptyQueueError if this queue is empty.
        """


class EmptyQueueError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when calling dequeue on an empty queue."""

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """Return a string representation of this error."""
        return 'dequeue may not be called on an empty queue'
```

- Consider which end of the list is considered the front
	- contr. to [[10.5 Stacks|stacks]], there is a trade-off in choosing which end of the list is considered a front

# List-based implementation of the Queue ADT

Consider the following implementation.
- Beginning of the list (index 0) is the front of the queue
	- New items that are enqueued will be added at the end of the list
	- Items that are dequeued are removed from the beginning of the list

```python
class Queue:
    """A first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of items.

    Stores data in a first-in, first-out order. When removing an item from the
    queue, the most recently-added item is the one that is removed.

    >>> q = Queue()
    >>> q.is_empty()
    True
    >>> q.enqueue('hello')
    >>> q.is_empty()
    False
    >>> q.enqueue('goodbye')
    >>> q.dequeue()
    'hello'
    >>> q.dequeue()
    'goodbye'
    >>> q.is_empty()
    True
    """
    # Private Instance Attributes:
    #   - _items: The items stored in this queue. The front of the list represents
    #             the front of the queue.
    _items: list

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new empty queue."""
        self._items = []

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this queue contains no items.
        """
        return self._items == []

    def enqueue(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add <item> to the back of this queue.
        """
        self._items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the item at the front of this queue.

        Raise an EmptyQueueError if this queue is empty.
        """
        if self.is_empty():
            raise EmptyQueueError
        else:
            return self._items.pop(0)
```

## Implementation efficiency

- `Queue.enqueue` implementation calls `list.append`
	- $\Theta (1)$, constant time
- `Queue.dequeue` implementation calls `self._items.pop(0)`
	- $\Theta (n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of items stored in the queue
- Change back of list to be the front of the queue → swap these running times
- Presents a trade-off
	- Using array-based list → can *either* have an eficient enqueue or an efficient dequeue operation
