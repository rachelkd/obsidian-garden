## The four “layers” of a computer program

1. Data
2. Algorithms
3. User interface
4. Social impact

### Processing data: algorithms
Every area of computer science requires complex algorithms:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- computer graphics
- Scientific computing and numerical modelling
- Any time you want to store and analyze data efficiently

## Programming in Python
- Data
	- data types
	- literals
	- operators
	- comprehensions
	- data classes
	- object mutation
- Functions
	- built-in functions
	- methods
	- defining functions
- Control flow
	- if statements
	- for loops
	- while loops
	- raising expectations
- Modules
	- import statements
	- `math`, `datetime`, `random`, `doctest`, `pytest`, `hypothesis`, `python_ta`
- Class design
	- defining an initializer and other methods
	- inheritance
