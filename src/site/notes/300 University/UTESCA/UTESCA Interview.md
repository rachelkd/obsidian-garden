### Tell me about yourself.

- Hi, my name is Rachel Deng.
- I grew up in Vancouver, BC where I actively volunteered as a Junior Instructor for the University of British Columbia’s Geering Up, which is an engineering outreach program. I always knew I would go into a STEM-related field throughout my earlier education, but I think that the three years that I spent working with them solidified my passion for computer science and guided me towards something I believe to be my purpose: I like helping people in my community, I like working with people with different perspectives and backgrounds towards a goal, and I really enjoy leading and supporting those who are around me. 
- One thing that I am sure of is that I want to be around like-minded people with similar goals and aspirations. I think that web development is an outlet for me to do that and push my creativity. We live in a digital world, so web apps are exponentially becoming accessible to everyone, and I like how you can design and program a web app to do almost anything you want it to.
- Last year, I moved to Toronto to attend UofT. I am currently specializing in computer science, and I hope to also pursue a minor in history and philosophy of science. I think that HPS provides great insight into applications of science and engineering, and I really enjoy discussions about science and ethics because it re-highlights the people in our society that you impact, positively or negatively.
- Coming to UofT was a large adjustment. When I first met my roommates, they were talking about the Myers-Brigg personality test. They were going around sharing their results; all of them mentioned they were introverts. Then, they pointed at me and asked about my results to which I told them it also said introvert. They laughed, and they were like there is no way. You’re definitely an extrovert. They were right. I retook the test and got extrovert.
- In addition to being a people person, I am also very driven. When I commit to an assignment, I like giving it my all. This university has a reputation for being academically challenging, and after my first year here, I have definitely experienced that. I learned a lot about balancing school with my social relationships, and I hope to continue my undergrad education building more connections with my newer community at UofT. Joining clubs is one way of doing so.
- Right now, I am working as an coding camps instructor at UBC Geering Up for their STEM camps. I’ve realized that I am so grateful for being apart of a team long-term. I love being in a dynamic environment where I am forced to work with people, and they are also forced to work with me. This is one of my first experiences being apart of a long-term team, and I have literally never felt so supported in a group of people. I want to continue to pursue these types of opportunities to work with people and achieve our group and individual goals. So, it’s no surprise that I am excited at the opportunity to join UTESCA. 

### How do you balance your time?

- I am a big fan of organizational tools.
- I use Google Calendar a lot to plan my months. I like having an ideal schedule in my calendar just to keep myself grounded. Nevertheless, it’s an ideal schedule, so it often doesn’t go to plan, but that’s alright because underneath that, I have a real schedule. I have time blocked out for work, for meal-prepping, exercising, seeing friends, and other events that might show up in my life. I allocate time blocks to completing assignments and tasks ahead of deadlines.
- To keep track of deadlines, I use Notion databases. If a task takes a fixed amount of time, I try to do that first. Unfortunately, most of my tasks take variable time. So, I start early, get a feel of how I am progressing, and I find out how much time the task will take in the progress and adapt. 
- I prioritize tasks that are more important. If I am working in a team, my tasks become more important if my teammates need something that I am working on to build on their own work.
- I find it helpful to break big tasks into smaller, more tangible ones. If I can get in the flow completing the smaller tasks, it makes the bigger ones much easier to tackle. I think of smaller tasks like a warm-up; my creativity and ideas mostly develop during that process.

### Describe a situation where you had to work with someone or a group who had a different perspective than you.

- As a STEM Ambassador in UBC’s Engineering Outreach program, I was a full-stack developer of a social technology project. I successfully pitched an idea to create an application to assist individuals with speech disorders. I co-designed the user interface and turned the design into functioning code.
- Considering our intended users, I underscored accessibility in our plan and design.
- When a team member suggested we pursue profit by making our code closed source, I raised the concern that doing so would make it more difficult for other programmers from improving upon our project and distributing the technology to those in need. The team agreed to code open-sourced. 
- In times of conflict, communication is super important in a collaborative environment. Personally, I like to take a step back before moving forwards. I reconsider group goals and ask myself how important is it to the team if we do something the way I see it or the way that someone else sees it.


### Please give us a brief idea about why you are interested in UTESCA.

- I align with UTESCA’s mission to apply engineering design to address real-world problems in our community.
- I value education because it helps us develop the skills needed to inform others about our lives, whether that is publishing research, changing policies, or engineering tools and websites meant for people to use.
- The part that interests me the most about computer science and web development is how interdisciplinary it is. You can create a tech-related product for any field, and you learn a lot in the process. That opportunity is magnified in a consulting association like UTESCA.
- I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals who enjoy combining their practical skills with different industries, whether that is environmental science, urban studies, architecture, or health care.
- I enjoy learning beyond math and computer science. I think that UTESCA will provide a great network of people studying different things and people who have a variety of interests.

### What personal and professional goals would you like to achieve in the role(s) that you selected?

- As an incoming second-year student, I hope to build more connections within the UofT community and learn from professional consultants in different industries.
- I greatly value communicating, collaborating, and spending time with people.
- Professionally, I want to gain more real-world experience in front-end development on a team to achieve our collective goals. I am motivated to use and strengthen my skills and create a purposeful product.
- I am also really interested in the mentorship opportunities presented by UTESCA. It would be very nice to learn from someone with much more experience than me in consulting.

### What experience(s) do you have that would allow you to succeed on the UTESCA executive team?

- I’m a very curious person. I think that my identity is ever-changing.
- I enjoy seeking opportunities and projects that require me to apply skills learned in the classroom to address problems in my community.
- When I volunteered as a STEM Ambassador at UBC Geering Up Engineering Outreach, I co-designed and coded a web application with Figma and Svelte.js to assist communication for people with speech disorders. Not only did I enjoy working with my peers to craft a product that could produce positive change for my community, but I also just loved creating.
- Since then, I have made other web applications, such as a minimalistic Pomodoro timer, a song recommender using the Spotipy Python library and Flask, and my own personal portfolio, where I learned to use UI libraries in React.

# Questions:

1. What does a normal week look like as a UI/UX designer for U T E S C A? Like, are there weekly meetings with the whole team and separate meetings with the web team?
2. I was wondering how many people are on the web team. Is it just the front end lead and the UI designer?
3. How would you describe the people on the executive team? What kind of person are you looking for for this role, outside of the technical stuff?
4. I know that student teams are assigned to client projects. I was wondering what kind of clients does UTESCA work with? Are they normally start-up companies or non-profit organizations?
5. On your LinkedIn, it mentioned that one of UTESCA’s core services is: building mentorships with practising consultants. What does this mentorship specifically look like? What kind of support will I receive as a member of U T E S C A
