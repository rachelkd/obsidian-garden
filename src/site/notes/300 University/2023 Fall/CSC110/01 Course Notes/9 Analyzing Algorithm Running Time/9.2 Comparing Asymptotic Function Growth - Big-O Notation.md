#CSC110 

- This chapter mainly concerns functions mapping the natural numbers to the non-negative real numbers
	- $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$
- We are going to look at one such property:
	- long-term (*asymptotic*) growth of a function

> [!note]
> *Definition.*
> Let $f, g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$.
> We say that $g$ is **absolutely dominated by** $f$ when for all $n \in \mathbb{N}, g(n) \leq f(n)$.

- *Example.*
	- Let $f(n) = n^{2}$ and $g(n) = n$. Prove that $g$ is absolutely dominated by $f$.
	- *Proof.*
		- Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We want to show that $n \leq n^{2}$.
		  **Case 1:** Assume $n = 0$.
		  $$n^{2} = n = 0$$
		  **Case 2:** Assume $n \geq 1$. Then,
		  $$\begin{align*}
		  n &\geq 1 && \text{(by our assumption)}\\
		  n^{2} &\geq n && \text{(multiply both sides by } n \text{)} \\
		  n &\leq n^{2}
		  \end{align*}$$
		  <div class="right-align"> <span class="math display">\blacksquare</span> </div>

Absolute dominance is too strict for asymptotic growth.
Consider:

> [!note]
> *Definition.*
> Let $f, g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$.
> We say that **$g$ is dominated by $f$ up to a constant factor** when there exists a positive real number $c$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}, g(n) \leq c \cdot f(n)$.

- *Example.*
	- Let $f(n) = n^{2}$ and $g(n) = 2n$. Prove that $g$ is dominated by $f$ up to a constant factor.
	- *Proof.*
		- Let $c = 2$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We want to prove that $g(n) \leq c \cdot f(n)$ (i.e., $2n \leq 2n^{2}$)
		  **Case 1:** Assume $n = 0$. $2n = 0$ and $2n^{2} = 0$, so the inequality holds.
		  **Case 2:** Assume $n \geq 1$.
		  $$\begin{align*}
		  n &\geq 1 && \text{(by our assumption)} \\
		  2n^{2} &\geq 2n && \text{(multiplying both sides by } 2n \text{)} \\
		  2n &\leq 2n^{2}
		  \end{align*}$$
		  <div class="right-align"> <span class="math display">\blacksquare</span> </div>

This definition is still too restrictive as it has to hold for all values $n$.

Consider:
> [!note] 
> *Definition.*
> Let $f, g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$.
> We say that **$g$ is eventually dominated by $f$** when there exists $n_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, if $n \geq n_{0}$ then $g(n) \leq f(n)$.

- *Example.*
	- Let $f(n) = n^{2}$ and $g(n) = n + 90$. Prove that $g$ is eventually dominated by $f$.
	- *Proof.*
		- Let $n_{0} = 90$, let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and assume $n \geq n_{0}$. We want to prove that $n + 90 \leq n^{2}$.
		  $$\begin{align*}
		  n + 90 &\leq n + n && \text{(since } n \geq  90 ) \\
		  &= 2n \\
		  &\leq n \cdot n && \text{(since } n \geq 2) \\
		  &= n^{2}
		  \end{align*}$$
		  <div class="right-align"> <span class="math display">\blacksquare</span> </div>

This definition allows us to ignore "small" values of $n$ and focus on the *asymptotic* behaviour.

Consider the next definition that ignores both *constant factors* and *small values of $n$*:

> [!note] 
> *Definition.*
> Let $f, g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$. 
> - We say that **$g$ is eventually dominated by $f$ up to a constant factor** when there exists $c, n_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$, such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, if $n \geq n_{0}$ then $g(n) \leq c \cdot f(n)$.
> - We also say that <mark style="background: #FEFAD0A6;">$g$ is Big-O of $f$</mark> and write <mark style="background: #FEFAD0A6;">$g \in \mathcal{O}(f)$</mark>. 
> 	- We formally define $\mathcal{O}(f)$ to be the *set* of functions that are eventually dominated by $f$ up to a constant factor:
> 	  $$\mathcal{O}(f) = \{g \mid g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}, \text{ and } \exists c, n_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq n_{0} \implies g(n) \leq c \cdot f(n)\}$$

- *Example.*
	- Let $f(n) = n^{3}$ and $g(n) = n^{3} + 100n + 5000$. Prove that $g \in \mathcal{O}(f)$.
		- $n^{3} + 100n + 5000 \in \mathcal{O}(n^{3})$
	- *Proof.*
		- Let $c = 5101$ and $n_{0} = 1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and assume that $n \geq n_{0}$. We want to show that $n^{3} + 100n + 5000 \leq cn^{3}$.
		    1. $n^{3} \leq n^{3}$ (since the two quantities are equal)
		    2. Since $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we know that $n \leq n^{3}$, and so $100n \leq 100n^{3}$.
		    3. Since $1 \leq n$, we know that $1 \leq n^{3}$, and then multiplying both sides by 5000 gives us $5000 \leq 5000n^{3}$.
		- Adding these three inequalities gives us:
		  $$n^{3} + 100n + 5000 \leq n^{3} + 100 n^{3} + 5000n^{3} = 5101n^{3} = cn^{3}$$

# Summary

- We covered four definitions used to compare two functions.
    1. Absolute dominance
        - The strictest
    2. Dominance up to a constant factor
    3. Eventual dominance
    4. $g \in \mathcal{O}(f)$
       $$g \in \mathcal{O}(f) : \exists c, n_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{+},
       \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq n_{0} \implies g(n) \leq c \cdot f(n)$$
