#CSC110 
# Divisibility, primality, and the greatest common divisor

> [!note]  
> *Definition*. Let $n, d \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say that $d$ **divides** $n$ when there exists a $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n = dk$.
> - $d \mid n$ means "$d$ divides $n$"

The following phrases are anonymous:
- $n$ is divisible by $d$
- $d$ is a factor of $n$
- $n$ is a multiple of $d$
<br>
- Mathematical predicate in formal logic:
	- $$d \mid n : ``\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, n = dk'' \; \text{where } n, d \in \mathbb{Z}$$

> *Definition*. Let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say $p$ is **prime** when it is greater than 1 and the only natural numbers that divide it are 1 and itself.

- Mathematical predication in formal logic:
	- $$IsPrime(p) : p > 1 \; \wedge \; (\forall d \in \mathbb{N}, d \mid p \implies d = 1 \; \vee \; d = p), \; \text{where } p \in \mathbb{Z}$$

> *Definition*. Let $m, n, d \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say that $d$ is a **common divisor** of $m$ and $n$ when $d$ divides $m$ and $d$ divides $n$.

- We say that $d$ is the **greatest common divisor** of $m$ and $n$ when:
	- it is the largest number that is a common divisor of $m$ and $n$
	- or 0 when $m$ and $n$ are both 0

- We can define the function $\text{gcd} : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
	- Function takes numbers $m$ and $n$
	- Returns their greatest common divisor
		- e.g., $\text{gcd}(10,4)=2$ and $\text{gcd}(-30,18)=6$

- Since 1 divides every integer, 1 is a common divisor between any two natural numbers (at the very least)
- When 1 is the *only* positive divisor between two numbers, we call them **coprime**

# Quotients, remainders, and modular arithmetic

> [!note]
> **Theorem.** (Quotient-Remainder Theorem)
> For all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $d \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, there exists $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $r \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n = qd + r$ and $0 \leq r < d$.
> - $q$ and $r$ are *unique* for a given $n$ and $d$
> - $q$ is the **quotient**, $r$ is the **remainder** when $n$ is divided by $d$

- Compute quotient using `//`, and compute the remainder using `%`
	- `divmod` returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder

> [!note]
> *Definition*. Let $a, b, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and assume $n \neq 0$.  We say that $a$ is **equivalent to $b$ modulo $n$** when $n \mid a - b$.
> - We write: $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$
> 	- e.g., $10 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$ and $9 \equiv -111 \pmod{5}$

**Modular equivalence can be used to divide up numbers based on their remainders when divided by $n$.**

> [!note]
> **Theorem.** Let $a, b, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n \neq 0$. 
> Then, $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $n$.
> $$\forall a, b, n, \in \mathbb{Z}, n \neq 0 \implies (a \equiv b \pmod{n}) \iff (a \; \% \; n = b \; \% \; n)$$

**Almost all of the "standard" intuitions we have about equality transfer over to this new notation.**

> [!note] 
> **Theorem.** Let $a,b,c,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n \neq 0$. Then:
> 1. $a \equiv a \pmod{n}$
> 2. $a \equiv b \pmod{n} \implies b \equiv a \pmod{n}$
> 3. $a \equiv b \pmod{n} \text{ and } b \equiv c \pmod{n} \implies a \equiv c \pmod{n}$

> [!note]
> **Theorem.** Let $a,b,c,d,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n \neq 0$.
> If $a \equiv c \pmod{n} \text{ and } b \equiv d \pmod{n}$, then:
> 1. $a + b \equiv c + d \pmod{n}$
> 2. $a - b \equiv c - d \pmod{n}$
> 3. $a \times b \equiv c \times d \pmod{n}$
