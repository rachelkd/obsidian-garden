# The Stack ADT

- Stack ADT
	- Contains zero or more items
	- Add an item → goes on top of the stack
		- *“pushing”*
	- Remove an item → Remove from top
		- *“popping”*
	- *Last-In-First-Out* behaviour
- Stack
	- Data: collection of items
	- Operations: determine whether stack is empty, add an item (*push*), remove the most recently-added item (*pop*)
- Hence, call stacks and stack frames:
	- Store the names available at a given moment in its execution
	- When we call `f` which calls `h`, which calls `h`:
		- When `h` is over, we go back to `g` → back to `f`

# Implementing the Stack ADT using lists

```python
from typing import Any


class Stack1:
    """A last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of items.

    Stores data in first-in, last-out order. When removing an item from the
    stack, the most recently-added item is the one that is removed.

    Instance Attributes:
        - items: The items stored in the stack. The end of the list represents
          the top of the stack.

    >>> s = Stack1()
    >>> s.is_empty()
    True
    >>> s.push('hello')
    >>> s.is_empty()
    False
    >>> s.push('goodbye')
    >>> s.pop()
    'goodbye'
    """
    items: list

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new empty stack.
        """
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this stack contains no items.
        """
        return self.items == []

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add a new element to the top of this stack.
        """
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the element at the top of this stack.

        Preconditions:
            - not self.is_empty()
        """
        return self.items.pop()
```

# Attributes and the class interface

- private instance attributes
	- prefix variable name with `_`
- public instance attributes
	- every other instance attribute

Consider the following `Stack1` data class:
```python
class Stack1:
    """A last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of items.

    Stores data in first-in, last-out order. When removing an item from the
    stack, the most recently-added item is the one that is removed.

    >>> s = Stack1()
    >>> s.is_empty()
    True
    >>> s.push('hello')
    >>> s.is_empty()
    False
    >>> s.push('goodbye')
    >>> s.pop()
    'goodbye'
    """
    # Private Instance Attributes:
    #   - _items: The items stored in the stack. The end of the list represents
    #     the top of the stack.
    _items: list

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new empty stack.
        """
        self._items = []

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this stack contains no items.
        """
        return self._items == []

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add a new element to the top of this stack.
        """
        self._items.append(item)

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the element at the top of this stack.

        Preconditions:
            - not self.is_empty()
        """
        return self._items.pop()
```

<div class="caption" style="color: grey"><i>Documentation and renamed items to _items</i></div>

## Private attributes can be accessed

```python
>>> s = Stack1()
>>> s.push(10)
>>> s.push(20)
>>> s._items
[10, 20]
```

- Private attributes *<u>communicate</u>* to client that code should *not* access this attribute

# Comparing stack implementations with running-time analysis

```python
class Stack2:
    # Duplicated code from Stack1 omitted. Only push and pop are different.

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add a new element to the top of this stack.
        """
        self._items.insert(0, item)

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the element at the top of this stack.

        Preconditions:
            - not self.is_empty()
        """
        return self._items.pop(0)
```

- The `list.append` operation for an array-based list is $\Theta (1)$
	- `Stack1.push` also has a $\Theta (1)$ running time.
- `list.insert` has complexity $\Theta (n-i)$, where $i$ is the index argument passed to `list.insert`
	- `Stack2.push` has $i = 0$, so method has complexity $\Theta (n)$
- `push` operation for stacks is <u>more efficient</u> when the end of an array-based list is the top of the stack (`Stack1`)

- Removing the last element of an array-based list using `list.pop` is also $\Theta (1)$
	- `Stack1.pop` is in $\Theta(1)$
- `Stack2.pop` passes an index of 0 to `list.pop` → method has a $\Theta (n)$ running time.

The decision of which implementation has superior efficiency is clear: `Stack1` will always be more efficient than `Stack2`.
