# Abstraction in computer science

- interface (of an entity)
	- boundary between creator and user
	- the set of rules (implicit or explicit) governing how users can interact with that entity
	- the *public* side of an entity
		- the part of the creator’s work that everyone can interact it
- Creators are responsible for the design of the interface, while users are responsible for learning the interface in order to interact with the entity.
	- e.g., the interface of a cup is how you use it
		- where to put liquid and where to hold it when taking a drink
- Function interface:
	- header and docstring
		- specify how to call the function, the arguments it expects, and what the function does
	- Function body is the implementation of the function → not part of its interface
- Data class interface:
	- name of the data class, names and types of its attributes, and class docstring
		-  _Every_ part of what we write to define a new data class is part of its interface
		- How data classes are actually implemented is hidden in the `@dataclass` decorator
- Python module interface:
	- collection of interfaces of the functions and data types defined in that module, any additional documentation in the module docstring

> [!note]
> Interfaces are contracts between the creator and the user
