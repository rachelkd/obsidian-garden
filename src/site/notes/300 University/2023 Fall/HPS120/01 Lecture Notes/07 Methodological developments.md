# Why do you trust your doctor?

- I trust... 
	- the medical science to have the right answers
	- the institution of doctors
	- this person in particular

- Would you rather have somebody that is fresh out of medical school
	- Trained out of the latest and greatest version of medical science
- Or someone who has trained for years and years
- Statistically, you are better off with the medical student

> [!note]
> This lecture will look at the shift from the **qualifications** of an individual vs. individual who has worked with the best available science (not a property of an individual, but a property of the system that produced them)
# Intentional Ignorance

- Reading this week (Kaptchuk, 1998) offers a history of placebo trials

How do we get from "I trust this person because they've been practicing for a long time" to "I trust this person because they are using the best available science?"
- The gold standard for evidence for medical intervention is:
	- the placebo double-blind controlled study

- Historians as a discipline strongly focus on description, not judgement
	- History tries to break up what seems so obvious to us
- It seems like Kaptchuk has views on the situation, but Prof. doesn't think so: he is reading with no judgement

# Franz Mesmer (1734 - 1815)

- German doctor
	- wrote his dissertation on how the moon and planets influenced human health
- This wasn't astrology
	- instead, an attempt to extend Newton's (relatively new) theory of gravity
- Tried to influence the "tides" in a patient's body by having them swallow some iron, and attaching magnets to them
- Tried to create internal tides in his patients
	- Patient had a case of hysteria (when women do not do what they are told)
	- She reported some relief from her hysteria
- Decided that it could not have just been the magnets
	- It was something about him personally; **he had some special property** to move the fluids in a person around to provide relief
		- *"animal magnetism"*

# Group Mesmerism

- Mesmer tried to get mainstream scientific acceptance for his views
	- Moved to Paris in 1781
	- It did not work; they did not buy it
	- Started a private practice for treating people – almost exclusively women
- It became a kind of fad
	- People were strongly divided on whether it was real or not:
		- Is animal magnetism real, or is he a scam artist?

# A Royal Commission

Louis the 16th called a *Royal commission* to decide whether there was anything to this
- **This commission did some of the first blind tests on record.**
	- Trials involved literally blindfolding subjects

## Features of this blind test
- Medical establishment facing something from outside
	- Mesmer has a PhD, but his theory is coming from outside

# Homeopathy

- Developed in the very late 1700s, early 1800s by **Samuel Hahnemann**
- Basic idea of homeopathy
	- small amounts of a substance which cause a symptom can cure a disease which also causes that symptom
	- e.g., if you have a fever, a tiny amount of a substance which causes increase in body temperature will cure your disease
- ‘Simila similibus curentur’
	- slogan: ‘like cures like’

<br>

- Hahnemann also believed that when you introduce an ingredient into water, the water retains some of the "spiritual vital essence" of it
	- Dilute water $\implies$ supposed to actually increase the power of the medicine
- Homeopathic remedies are typically so dilute that it’s unlikely that even a single molecule of the original ingredient is present

# Armand Trousseau

- French doctor
- Practised standard medicine
	- Took it upon himself to test homeopathic cures
- Did placebo trials:
	- Gave people inert pills, but told them it was homeopathic remedies
- Found that the bread pills worked about as well as the homeopathic ones
- But, *this was* ***single blind***.
	- Trousseau knew which pills were which
	- Involved no careful statistical methods:
		- He knew what it looked like to get better
- His method:
	1. rounded up about 10 patients
	2. lied to them about what they were receiving
	3. watched what happened

# The Brown-Séquard Elixir

- Another example which doctors felt the need to apply rigorous placebo-controlled trials:
	- was an extract of animal testicles, from monkeys, dogs, bulls, or guinea pigs
- Brown-Sequard claimed that injecting this extract would bring back youth and vitality to older men

- *Dr. M.G. Variot* found the claims made in the popular press about the elixir to be fanciful
	- The press talked about the elixir being the “fountain of youth” and the “Alchemists dream”
- The placebo trial:
	- *Variot* tried the extract on three elderly men,
		- reported feeling great
	- Then tried injecting just saline on two more men
		- told them it was the elixir
		- reported no change

# Placebo Trials

People start applying placebo trials to mainstream medical interventions. By mid-1800s:
- Austin Flint explores this idea called ***therapeutic nihilism***
	- The idea that no medicine at all was just as good as what doctors were doing
- Flint's placebo trial:
	- Tried giving a placebo to 13 patients with rheumatism (joint pain)
	- Found that placebo group did as well as the patients with intervention (real medicine)
		- Made him think that he was not doing any good
	- Supports *therapeutic nihilism* for his specific interventions
- Innovation of Flint's trial from everything before:
	- **He is doing trials on mainstream medicine**

# Polio Vaccine

> [!note] 
> The first large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials upon which careful statistics were applied was the **polio vaccine** (1950s).

Jonas Salk came up with the polio vaccine, and he wanted to do a very careful test.
- In 1955, the American Medical Association was willing to print the opinion that the evaluation of drugs "should be kept in the hand of the general practitioner and not be on the basis of experiments"
	- AMA is saying trust your doctor because they, as an individual, *know what they are doing*.
		- Not because of some double-blind trial
	- Polio vaccine came one year after
- But, we also saw a massive, highly publicized placebo-controlled trial for the Polio vaccine
	- in the 1950s
## Francis Field Trial (1956)
- Largest medical experiment in history up until that point
	- 1.8M children were involved
- Method:
	- 440,000 were given the vaccine (*Intervention arm*)
	- 210,000 were given a placebo (*Placebo arm*)
	- Rest were used as a control group (*No intervention arm*)

Purposes of the three arms:
1. Intervention arm
	- Maybe the vaccine actually works
2. Placebo arm
	- Maybe the placebo effect is so powerful that it helps people get better
3. No intervention arm
	- Maybe people spontaneously get better on their own

> [!note]
> Placebo-controlled trials are now the standard

# Placebos

- "Placebo" is latin for "I shall please"
- There is really no effect with a placebo
	- If a doctor has an effective treatment, they will give it to you
		- If they do not, they might give you something to calm you down, make you happy, leave your money behind, and go home.
			- E.g., some doctors might give you antibiotics for influenza
				- Influenza is a virus, antibiotics treat bacteria
	- Doctors want a good doctor-patient relationship:
		- They might give you a placebo, just to maintain your trust in the system
		> [!note]
		> There is a side to this debate that argues: "we have to give something to these patients to build trust, or else they will not come to us when we could help them"

   - But you're lying to the patient: controversial



> "[Placebo] is ordinarily taken to mean a procedure undertaken to gratify the patient’s desire for active intervention, but which is understood by the doctor to be inert and useless." 
> 
> Houston (1938) The Doctor Himself as a Therapeutic Agent. *Annals of Internal Medicine* 11:416-425



> “But above all he must entertain no misconceptions ; he must admit to himself the grounds on which he is making the concession [of giving a placebo]. In general these grounds are not of a high scientific or ethical order. The doctor is afraid of losing the case. Let us note here the remarkable contrast between the attitude of the house surgeon and that of the young practitioner. In the former capacity he was only too pleased when a troublesome patient decided to leave and thus free a bed for a more satisfactory case ; as a practitioner he is likely to have quite other feelings in the matter.”
> 
> Crichton-Miller, H. (1932). Primitive Man and the Modern Patient. British medical journal, 2(3739), 430.

- When you are a young, steady doctor working case-by-case, and you have to get clients, Crichton-Miller thinks you will be handing out placebos
- vs. a salary job, you might be more likely to tell a patient to go home and rest
# The Placebo Effect
- There is some debate about the placebo effect
<br>
- **Common take about placebos:**
	> “Indeed, experimental studies have shown that placebo, as well as being particularly effective for the relief of pain and inflammation, can, for example, speed wound healing, boost immune responses to infection, cure angina, prevent asthma, lift depression, and even help fight cancer”
	> 
	> Humphrey, N. (2002). Great expectations: The evolutionary psychology of faith healing and the placebo effect. In Psychology at the Turn of the Millennium, Volume 2 (pp. 241-259). Psychology Press.
	
- Before statistics, people thought that placebos were just used to *please* the patient
- After statistics, people began to think that maybe there is some effect to placebos
- **Your belief alters your perception of your experience**
	- Your expectations of a thing alter the way that you perceive it
	- e.g., rating pain: 
		- You ask a patient to rate their pain – it is only accessible to the patient. 
- But, "fighting cancer"?
	- Cancer treatments are not just limited to *self-report*
	- There are clear non self-reporting data for cancer
		- Placebo effect seems to show up there, too

# Increasing Effective Placebos

![placebo_response_data.png|500](/img/user/Files/HPS120/placebo_response_data.png)
Tuttle, A. H., Tohyama, S., Ramsay, T., Kimmelman, J., Schweinhardt, P., Bennett, G. J., & Mogil, J. S. (2015). Increasing placebo responses over time in US clinical trials of neuropathic pain. _Pain_, _156_(12), 2616-2626.

- Oddly, the size of placebo effects in some categories seems to be increasing over time
- Tuttle et. al found a steady increase in placebo responses in trials of painkillers for neuropathic pain
	- Nerves causing pain – pain receptions going crazy
	- Doctors give analgesics (painkillers)
	- There is a placebo arm and intervention arm

Is this a causal effect or statistical artifact?
- Is there actually an increase in power of the placebo effect?
- Are people actually getting more symptomatic relief than they used to?
- This data only happens in America
	- The same trend did not appear in Europe or Asia
	- The US sample sizes got larger in sample size, and longer in how they follow people
- Maybe they see the initial "I'm feeling better," which makes them happier, which makes them feel better

# Open Label Trials

- Open label trials:
	- Tell people, "Here's a placebo. This pill does nothing. Take it."
	- It *still* helps people
- **Solution** for the people against placebos ("you're lying to people"):
	- You can tell the patients that it is a placebo, and it will still work.

## Placebo effects vs. placebo response

- Placebo effects are an effect on the individual due to the placebo treatment
	- Effects on individual of taking a placebo pill
- Placebo response are the signal in the data
	- include everything that happens in the *placebo arm*
	- can get signals in data that do not represent causal effects on individuals
	- including, just naturally getting better, regression to the mean, and the *"Hawthorne effect"*

## Hawthorne Effect
- 1920s, has to do with the doctor-patient relationship
- A series of studies were done at Hawthorne Works, a factory that made electrical appliances
- Wanted to experiment if increasing the lighting increased worker productivity
	- Lighting increased $\rightarrow$ worker productivity increased
	- Lighting decreased $\rightarrow$ ALSO increased
- Worker productivity decreased only when the study stopped...

> [!note] Hawthorne Effect
> People change their behaviour in response to being observed.

# Placebo vs. No Treatment

Some meta-analyses have found only modest placebo effects across studies that compare it to no-treatment.
- *Did* find some effects in things like pain and phobias

# A defence of placebo effects

- Finniess et al. addresses these meta-studies
	- argue that placebos do much better in studies that are specifically about placebo mechanisms
- Claim that this is likely because they are paying closer attention to the language and presentation of the placebo
	- more closely mimicking clinical practice

<br>

- There is a real difference between being in a clinical trial and being in a doctor's office
	- If you're specifically studying the placebo effect, you are a lot more careful about the presentation of the drug
		- Much more specific instructions on how to phrase, how to act

# The medical significance of being nice

Howe, L. C., Goyer, J. P., & Crum, A. J. (2017). Harnessing the placebo effect: Exploring the influence of physician characteristics on placebo response.Health Psychology,36(11), 1074.

- Put something on their skin that will give it irritation
	- Give something that is supposed to relieve the irritation
- Placebo effect only has an effect when there is a nice, positive, friendly provider.
