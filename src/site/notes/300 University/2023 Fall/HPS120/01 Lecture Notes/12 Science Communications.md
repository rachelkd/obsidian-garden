# Exam Stuff

- Choose 4/6 terms from weeks 10-12 inclusive
	- Explain them
- Choose 1/2 short essay questions
	- Same number of marks as four terms; should be same length

## Short essay questions
1. ==How should we think about science?==
2. What are the most important changes that should be made to the current scientific method?
3. ==When (if ever) should we believe that science produces objective truth?==

If you prepare for two, you are guaranteed to see at least one of these.

**Rubric**
- Does the essay provide a good argument for a clear thesis?
- Does the essay accurately integrate course material?
- Is the essay well structured and easy to follow?
- Is the essay interesting and original?

# Hype

- Hype:
	- Specific topic in the broader field of science communications
	- How to keep the public up to date on what’s going on in science?
- “Public” is a funny term:
	- Can involve other scientists (e.g., if you are a physicist, you are apart of the public with respect to things going on in biology)
		- Subdivisions of disciplines can become the public of other subdivisions
	- How do you communicate within parts of science, let alone the masses?

# AI Hype

- Current largest wave of excitement in science news is undoubtedly AI
- Is it hype or well-justified excitement?
- We likely will not know except in retrospect

**A proposal for the dartmouth summer research project**
John McCarthy, Marvin L. Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude E. Shannon 1955

> “We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. *We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer*.” (my emphasis)

---

> “Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work that man can do.”
> — Herbert Simon (1956)

> “Within a generation … the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will substantially be solved.”
> — Marvin Minsky (1967)

- Fact that people have been saying artificial general intelligence is 10-20 years away since the 1950s does not mean it is not
- → Worth noting the very regular pattern of excitement and disappointment that has characterized this field of study since its beginnings
	- AI goes through peaks and troughs:
		- 1980s, AI Winter:
			- architectures they were working with hit their limits
			- largely working on symbolic AI:
				- teaching computer logic
				- turns out you need more than logic to be an intellectual agent

# The Hype Cycle

![hype_cycle_for_ai.png](/img/user/Files/HPS120/hype_cycle_for_ai.png)

- Gartner: consulting company that puts out these “hype cycle” predictions regularly
- Predict that we’ve reached peak hype for gen. AI
	- e.g., ChatGPT
- In 5-10 years, people will be significantly less excited about it, despite being significantly more advanced than it is now
- They could be wrong…

# Hype in Science Communications

- Weingart (2017) looks at science hype
	- Takes a careful look at what hype is, where it comes from and why, and what we can do about it
- Generally, science communications is just *communicating science*
- Deeply understanding a scientific discover is — in some sense — the domain of experts
	- Relatively small number of people

# Science Communications

Science communicators face a difficult set of tradeoffs:
- If a discovery is only available to specialists, it cannot help inform other areas of science, public understanding, or policy
	- Connects to [[300 University/2023 Fall/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/09 Fraud\|Sovacool]] reading: mentions somewhere that science also has social applications
	- Doing so would not allow science to have these social applications
- Making something widely understood typically involves simplifying, which tends to distort
	- Getting people to pay attention to stuff that is probably really boring in its details is hard
	- People do not have time to become experts in economics and climate science
	- Devil’s in the details: getting what is important or limitations of the discovery might be lost
	- Degree of simplification to get it across to the public is sometimes terrifying
- What do you do? You need to get the information out there; the details often matter. If you do not simplify, it will not get across.
	- Just a really hard tradeoff anytime one is doing scientific communications
- E.g., one of the areas that science communication is most concerning is **health** sciences:
	- In Weingart (2017)
	- Class of heart drugs gives 60% increase in bad outcomes
	- People stopped taking heart medication
	- But the chances went from 1% to 2%
		- Doctors understood this: the benefits of the heart medication outweigh the consequences
		- General public did not
		- Absolute risk remained tiny, [[300 University/2023 Fall/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/10 Meta-Analysis#How to Measure Study Outcomes?\|relative risk]] saw a big jump
		- People not understanding the difference between the two made bad health decisions because the science communication did not work

- Science communicators:
	- sometimes the scientists themselves, explaining their work to a wider public
	- often non-specialists in the field, either working for academic institutions, corporations, or media outlets, trying to communicate new science
- Neither, frankly, is ideally suited to the task, but someone has to do it!

# What is hype?

- Weingart does something Prof. Lewis never recommends:
	- Go to the dictionary for his definition of hype
	- If there is a disagreement on a meaning, the dictionary does not solve that for you
- Hype is excessive promotion of something, which exaggerates its importance or benefits
- Weingart asks us to distinguish **honest hype** from plain old hype
	- inevitable in communicating something you think is important

# Honest hype

- Any time you say anything, there is a presumption you think that this is important enough to say
- If you call a *press conference* → implicitly saying something is newsworthy
	- There is **nothing wrong** with scientists who legitimately believe they have discovered something important communicating that fact
- Promoting one’s ideas has become part of the job of a scientist:
	- as shown in [[300 University/2023 Fall/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/08 Peer Review\|08 Peer Review]]
	- One makes the best case they can for the importance of their discovery to get it published in the best journal one can
	- Communicating results to a broader public → interest → funding to the field
		- Administrators are not going to make people mad by cutting funding
		- Don’t cut funding → university will continue to rise in prestige and prominence in the world
		- → Become part of the task of a scientist
			- Go to conferences to get other scientists excited about what you are doing
			- Talk to non-specialists, media
			- Send it off to a journal to get them excited
		- In some sense, has become a part of the art of the job

# Dishonest hype

- Honest hype is very different from going to the press with exaggerated claims
- In the most extreme cases, shades directly into scientific fraud and misconduct
	- e.g., Andrew Wakefield; claimed vaccines caused autism with no evidence; goes to the media; lying to general public (in his case to sell his own vaccine)

# e.g., Melatonin hype

- Weingart cites the “melatonin as a fountain of youth” narrative that got picked up by the media about a decade ago

![melatonin_fountain_of_youth.png|300](/img/user/Files/HPS120/melatonin_fountain_of_youth.png)
<div class="caption" style="color: grey"><i>Note the critical question mark in the title.</i></div>

> “At Laboratoire Arago, Elodie Magnanou and her co-workers studied the long-term effects of melatonin on the Greater White-toothed shrew, a small nocturnal insectivorous mammal. Under normal conditions, this animal shows the first signs of aging after reaching 12 months, mainly through the loss of circadian rhythm in its activities. By continuously administering melatonin, starting a little before 12 months, the appearance of these first signs was delayed by at least 3 months, which is a considerable period in relation to the lifespan of this shrew*.”

![timing_of_the_shrew.png|300](/img/user/Files/HPS120/timing_of_the_shrew.png)

- Scientists implanted a melatonin releasing device in four shrews
	- Young shrews tend to be active at night
	- Old shrews relax more at night
- In the four screws they implanted the devices in, they stayed more active at night than control shrews
	- That is the whole study: four shrews moved around more at night
- More movement at night as they aged → “Melatonin: The Fountain of Youth?”
	- Of particular concern: melatonin is something you can buy at most pharmacies
	- People may make health decisions based on little more than the headline
		- Even worse, interpret one pill as a single dose, so you take more melatonin
- News headline was less careful than the original research paper
	- Framed in a way to make it relevant, interesting, and exciting to the masses

# Defining exaggeration

![best-fit.png](/img/user/Files/HPS120/best-fit.png)

- 2022 article by Kristen Intemann questions definitions like Weingart’s
	- They’re too vague
	  
	  > “After all, virtually all scientific claims involve going beyond existing evidence to make generalizations and predictions, but presumably not all involve the sort of “exaggeration” that would constitute hype.” p.280
	  
	- Drawing a line of best fit is — in some important sense — going beyond the available evidence
		- Interpolating what would happen in between or outside of evidence
- Generalizing from a set of data
	- if you do not do that, you are not doing science
	- only making a series of observations
	- crafting of general theories makes something into science
- Argues: you need to know the context to define exaggeration properly

# How much hype is there?

- Hard to say — depends on how you define exaggeration
- 2004 study on articles about genetics (big hype at that time) found:
	- hype was not as bad as many feared

Bubela, T. M., & Caulfield, T. A. (2004). Do the print media “hype” genetic research? A comparison of newspaper stories and peer-reviewed research papers. Cmaj, 170(9), 1399-1407.

![genetics-exagerration-study.png|500](/img/user/Files/HPS120/genetics-exagerration-study.png)

- The more traditional a news outlet is, the less likely it is for exaggeration
- Weingart suggests the situation has gotten worse since then
	- A great deal of science journalism is copy-pasting press releases from labs, corps.
		- Labs, corps. want their thing out their; they write it up

# Scientific norms

- Weingart points out that hype is caught between conflicting scientific norms
	- **Novelty** and **relevance** are highly sought after properties of scientific discoveries
		- Focus on that has become a scientific norm
	- **Modesty** and **careful attention** to the scope and limits of one’s research are likewise scientific norms
- Conflict is not an unusual situation to be in:
	- e.g., There is a moral norm to be nice and honest; those often pull tension at each other
	- Scientists are being pulled in both directions at once
- Perhaps, we define **dishonest hype** in terms of *violating the scientific norm of modesty*
	- Scientists are supposed to apportion their belief to the degree of evidence available
	- If they make claims about the certainty or significance of their research not supported by evidence, then it is **dishonest hype**

# Who is hyping science?

- People vary in who they blame for scientific hype:
	- Some scientists blame the <u>media</u> for misreporting
	- Some science journalists blame <u>scientists</u> for not providing enough access to them and their research to properly present it
		- Insufficiently transparent with journalists
		- Journalists might receive a press article → want to interview scientists → scientists are unavailable; read the press article
- Weingart points out that traditional media have been hollowed out in the last decade or two
	- → science journalists increasingly reliant on press released *crafted by* the institutions they report on

> “This danger is exacerbated by the now common use of social media, above all Twitter and Facebook, by scientific organizations that spread their messages directly to the broader public without any quality check by “gatekeepers” such as journalistic media.” (p. 114)

# Incentives for hype

- Weingart points out that the incentives to overhype a scientific finding are not that different than incentives for [[300 University/2023 Fall/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/09 Fraud\|scientific fraud]]
- **Immense pressure** on individuals, institutions, and whole disciplines to produce earth-shattering results
	- Careers *depend* on delivering big results
	- If your lab is not pumping out interesting results, you might not be able to keep doing that
- Interest of institutions to give the impression that they are funding groundbreaking research
- Private companies want people to believe that they are doing big things
- There is a spectrum from dishonest hype to fraud

---
## Pure and applied hype

- When *media* does the hype → temptation to hype applied research is particularly strong:
	- People tend to be interested in things that directly affect them
	- e.g., health, economics; much more likely to catch their interest; make it spicy → even more likely to catch interest

---

- **Nations** and their science policies may also be addition to the incentives for hype
	- e.g., [[300 University/2023 Fall/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/09 Fraud#Hwang Woo-Suk\|Hwang]] received pressure from the national level; pressure not only institutional but political and national

  > “In other words, science policy strategies to open science to society have the (perhaps unintended) consequence of creating a political environment that counteracts the negative sanctioning of hype within science. By rewarding popular applause, this culture replaces the internal public of competent peers with the general public of laymen.” (p.115)
  
  - Good idea to communicate science, get people interested and excited about science
	  - But, you do create a market pressure on scientists when you do that

---
# Why is hype even a problem?

1. People may just *misunderstand* the science → make bad choices on that basis
	- e.g., taking huge doses of melatonin
2. Overall public trust in science may be eroded over time
	- e.g., if all you see is “cancer breakthrough; in five years, we’ll have that sorted,” and you see that headline for the past 10 years, you might start to get cynical
	- Counterargument: those are not actual breakthroughs; the way of communicating is just not respect the actual complexity of the problem they are facing

---
# What to do about hype?

- Weingart is sympathetic to individuals and institutions who have to navigate the marketplace of ideas:
	- Current climate: reasonable for scientists and institutions to do their best to promote their discoveries
	- Institutions are competing for prestige → prestige brings high-quality students → donations, grants
		- Makes sense to put out glowing press releases about how all the stuff they’re doing is interesting and important
- Many of the solutions to scientific misconduct apply equally well to hype
	- e.g., give scientists credit for incremental findings, negative findings, and publishing in Open Science formats
	- If you remove “splash factor” from hiring, promotion, grant funding decisions, a lot of these incentives go away
		- By changing those *systemic* incentives, maybe you can reduce the amount of hype

---
# Scientific method(s): a work in progress
- There is a process
- There are often anomalies that reshape how we think about our paradigms
	- Not every anomaly means that the system is crashing down
	- Understanding the paradigm is shifting helps you stay grounded and not overly commit to any given bit of science
	- Getting something through peer review does *not* mean it is a fact; it is a potential fact, ready to be taken up to much longer vetting that science always produces

---
# Rolling back the horizon

- Shouldn’t love science because it always gets the right answers, or has the methods all figured out
- Should love it because of its complexity and messiness
	- That is what it is like to push back the limits of human knowledge
