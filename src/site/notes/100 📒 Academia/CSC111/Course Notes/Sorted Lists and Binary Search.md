# Motivation.

Recall the standard way of search for an item in a list:

```python
def search(lst: list, item: Any) -> int:
    """Return whether item appears in this list."""
    for element in lst:
        if element == item:
            return True

    return False
```
*Worst-case running time of $\Theta (n)$.*

> [!tip] If we have a *sorted* list, then we do not need to check all of its elements: **binary search**

e.g., Suppose we have a sorted list `lst` containing one million numbers. We want to search for the number 111.
- If we check the middle element ($i = 500 000$), there are three possibilities:
    - If `111` is equal to `lst[500000]`, then
        - we have found the item and can return `True`
    - If `111` is less than `lst[500000]`, then
        - we know it must appear in the left half of the list
        - *ignore* all elements with index `>= 500000`
    - If `111` is greater than `lst[500000]`, then
        - we know it must appear in the right half of the list
        - *ignore* all elements with index `< 500000`
