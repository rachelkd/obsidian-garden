# GCD and Remainders

> [!note] **Theorem.** (Quotient-Remainder Theorem)
> For all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $d \neq 0$, then there exists $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $r \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n = qd + r$ and $0 \leq r < |d|$.

- quotient
	- $q$, when $n$ is divided by $d$
- remainder
	- $r$, when $n$ is divided by $d$
	- $r = n \;\%\; d$

# GCD, Remainders, and the Euclidean Algorithm

> [!note] Theorem.
> For all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $b \neq 0$, $\text{gcd}(a,b) = \text{gcd}(b, a \;\%\; b)$.


## Algorithm

*Example*: $a = 24, b = 16$
- Since the remainder $24 \;\%\; 16$ is 8,
	- $\text{gcd}(24,16) = \text{gcd}(16,8)$
- Also, the remainder $16 \;\%\; 8$ is 0.
	- $\text{gcd}(16, 8) = \text{gcd}(8, 0)$
- The GCD of any positive integer $n$ and $0$ is $n$ itself, so
	- $\text{gcd}(8,0) = 8$
- So, $\text{gcd}(24,16) = 8$

This is the ***Euclidean Algorithm***.

*Given*: non-negative integers `a` and `b`.
*Returns*: `gcd(a,b)`

1. Initialize two variables `x`, `y` to the given numbers `a`, `b`.
2. Let `r` be the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`.
3. Reassign `x` and `y` to `y` and `r`, respectively.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `y` is 0.
5. At this point, `x` refers to the gcd of `a` and `b`.

*Example*: $a = 24, b = 16$

|*Iteration*|`x`|`y`|
|-----|---|----|
|0|24|16|
|1|16|8|
|2|8|0|

# The while loop

- while loop
	- Python compound statement
	```Python
	while <condition>:
		<statement>
		...
	```
	1. First executes while loop condition
	2. If `True`, interpreter executes the statements in the loop body
	3. If `False`, interpreter skips over the loop body
	4. After executing loop body, if condition is still `True`, then body is repeated

# Implementing the Euclidean Algorithm

- parallel assignment
	- multiple variables can be assigned in the same statement
	<br>
	The assignment statement `x, y = y, r` is evaluated as follows:
		1. Right-hand side `y, r` is evaluated, producing two objects.
		2. Then, each object is assigned to the corresponding variable on the left-hand side.

```Python
def euclidean_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the gcd of a and b.

    Preconditions:
    - a >= 0
    - b >= 0
    """
    # Step 1: initialize x and y
    x, y = a, b

    while y != 0:  # Step 4: repeat Steps 2 and 3 until y is 0
        # Step 2: calculate the remainder of x divided by y
        r = x % y

        # Step 3: reassign x and y
        x, y = y, r

    # Step 5: x now refers to the gcd of a and b
    return x
```

# The Extended Euclidean Algorithm

From *GCD Characterization Theorem*, $\text{gcd}(m,n)$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written as a linear combination of $m$ and $n$.
- How do we find the gcd, and the coefficients $p$ and $q$?

```Python
def extended_euclidean_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]:
    """Return the gcd of a and b, and integers p and q such that

    gcd(a, b) == p * a + b * q.

    Preconditions:
    - a >= 0
    - b >= 0

    >>> extended_euclidean_gcd(13, 10)
    (1, -3, 4)
    """
	x, y = a, b  
	px, qx = 1, 0  
	py, qy = 0, 1  
	  
	while y != 0:  
	    assert math.gcd(x, y) == math.gcd(a, b)  
	    assert x == px * a + qx * b  
	    assert y == py * a + qy * b  
	  
	    q, r = divmod(x, y)  
	  
	    x, y = y, r  
	  
	    px, qx, py, qy = py, qy, px - (q * py), qx - (q * qy)  
	  
	return x, px, qx
