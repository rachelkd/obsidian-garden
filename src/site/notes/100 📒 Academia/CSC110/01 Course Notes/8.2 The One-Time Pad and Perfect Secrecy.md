#CSC110
# The one-time pad

- Encryption in the one-time pad
	- Shifts each character in the plaintext message
		- Much like [[100 ðŸ“’ Academia/CSC110/01 Course Notes/8.1 An Introduction to Cryptography#Caesar's substitution cipher\|Caesar's cipher]]
	- Shift is *not* the same for each character
	- Uses a **string** of length greater than or equal to the length of the plaintext message to be encrypted
- To *encrypt* a plaintext ASCII message $m$ with secret key $k$, for each index $i$ between 0 and $|m|-1$, compute:
	- $$c[i] = (m[i] + k[i]) \;\%\; 128$$
		- $m[i]$ and $k[i]$ are converted to their numeric representations to do the arithmetic
- To *decrypt*,
	- Take ciphertext `c`
	- $$m[i] = (c[i] - k[i]) \;\%\; 128$$

*Example.* Encrypt plaintext `'HELLO'` with secret key `'david'`.
- Ciphertext will have five characters
	- First is `'H' + 'd' == ','`
	- Second is `'E' + 'a' == '&'`
- Encrypts to `',&B53'`

## Why the decryption works

Disclaimer: This is my own work.

$$\begin{align*}
c[i] &= (m[i] + k[i]) \; \% \; 128 \\
\implies (m[i] + k[i]) &\equiv c[i] \pmod{128} \\
\implies m[i] &\equiv c[i] - k[i] \pmod{128} \\
\implies m[i] &= (c[i] - k[i]) \;\%\; 128
\end{align*}$$

# Perfect secrecy and its costs

- perfect secrecy
	- Ciphertext reveals no information about its corresponding plaintext other than its length
- Take `',&B53'` from example:
	- Ciphertext could have been generated by *any* five-letter plaintext message
	- For any such message, there exists a secret key that could encrypt that message to obtain `',&B53'`.
		- Sender could have also been sending `'FUNNY'` with secret key `'fQtgZ'`
- Eavesdropper cannot gain any info about original plaintext

## Drawbacks

- Secret key must have at least the same length as the message being sent
- Key cannot be reused
	- Loses its perfect secrecy if so

# Stream ciphers

- stream ciphers
	- type of symmetric-key cryptosystem
	- emulate a one-time pad
	- share a much smaller secret key
- Shared secret key is quite small
- Both parties use...
	- an *algorithm* to generate **an arbitrary number of new random characters**
		- based on secret key *and* previously-generated characters
- Characters are then used in the same way as one-time pad to encrypt

## Stream ciphers and perfect secrecy

- Do stream ciphers have perfect secrecy?
	- No
	- Characters in encryption are not truly random
- If the generating algorithm is clever enough, each new character appears "random"
	- Encrypted messages are computationally impossible to decrypt without knowing the starting secret key
