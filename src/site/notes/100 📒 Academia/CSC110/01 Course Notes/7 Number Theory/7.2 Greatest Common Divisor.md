> *Definition*. Let $x,y,d \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say that $d$ is a **common divisor** of $x$ and $y$ when $d$ divides $x$ and $d$ divides $y$.

We say that $d$ is the **greatest common divisor** of $x$ and $y$ when it is the largest number that is a common divisor of $x$ and $y$, or $0$ when $x$ and $y$ are both $0$.
$$\text{gcd} : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$$
- Restate the "maximum" part:
	- If $e$ is any number which divides $m$ and $n$, then $e \leq d$.
	Let $m,n,d \in \mathbb{Z}$.
	Suppose $d = \text{gcd}(m,n)$.
	Then, $d$ satisfies the following:
	$$\begin{aligned}\\ 
	(m = 0 \; \land \; n = 0 \implies d = 0) \;
	\land \; &\\
	(m \neq 0 \; \vee \; n \neq 0 \implies
	d \mid m \; \land \; 
	d \mid n \; \land \; 
	(\forall e \in \mathbb{N}, 
	e \mid m \; &\land \; 
	e \mid n \implies
	e \leq d))
	\end{aligned}$$

**Example.** Prove that for all integers $p$ and $q$, if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then $p$ and $q$ are *coprime*, meaning $\text{gcd}(p,q) = 1$.

$$$\forall p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, \; (Prime(p) \land Prime(q) \land p \neq q) \implies \text{ gcd}(p,q) = 1$$

- See answer [here](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc110y/fall/notes/07-number-theory/02-greatest-common-divisor.html).

*Proof.*
- Let $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$. Assume $p$ and $q$ are both prime, and that $p \neq q$. We want to show that $\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$.
	- By the definition of prime, we know that $p \neq 1$ (since $p > 1$).
	- Also by the definition of prime, we know that the possible of divisors of $q$ are $1$ and $q$ itself.
	- So, since $p \neq q$ (our assumption) and $p \neq 1$, we know that $p \nmid q$.
	- We know that $1$ divides every number (proved in 4.6), and so 1 is th eonly positive common divisor of $p$ and $q$, so $\text{gcd}(p,q) = 1$

# Linear combinations and the greatest common factor

> [!note]
> *Definition*. Let $m,n,a \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say that $a$ is a **linear combination of $m$ and $n$** when there exists $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $a = pm + qn$. 

> [!note]
> **Theorem.** (*Divisibility of Linear Combinations*)
> Let $m,n,d \in \mathbb{Z}$. If $d$ divides $m$ and $d$ divides $n$, then $d$ divides every linear combination of $m$ and $n$.

> [!note]
> **Theorem.** (*GCD Characterization*)
> Let $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and assume at least one of them is non-zero. Then, $\text{gcd}(m,n)$ is the smallest positive integer that is a linear combination of $m$ and $n$.

**Using these two theorems for a proof.**
Prove that for all $m,n,d \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $d$ divides both $m$ and $n$ then $d$ also divides $\text{gcd}(m,n)$.
$$\forall m,n,d \in \mathbb{Z}, d \mid n \land d \mid n \implies d \mid \text{gcd}(m,n)$$

*Proof.*
Let $m,n,d \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Assume $d \mid m$ and $d \mid n$.

<u>Case 1.</u> ($m = 0, n = 0$)
Then, $\text{gcd}(m,n) = 0$.
Since $m = 0$ and $n = 0$, $d$ must also divide $\text{gcd}(m,n)$ by our assumption.

<u>Case 2.</u> ($m \neq 0, n \neq 0$)
Then, by the GCD Characterization Theorem, we know there exists a $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\text{gcd}(m,n) = pm + qn$. By Divisibility of Linear Combinations, we know that $d$ must also divide $\text{gcd}(m,n)$ since $\text{gcd}(m,n)$ is a linear combination of $m$ and $n$.

Therefore, $d \mid \text{gcd}(m,n)$.
