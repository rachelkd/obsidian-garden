# Analyzing Algorithm Running Time

- basic operation
	- any block of code whose running time does not depend on the size of the input
		- includes all primitive language operations
			- e.g., most assignment statements, arithmetic calculations, list and string indexing
		- does **not** include function calls

```python
def print_items(lst: list) -> None:
	for item in lst:
		print(item)
```

- `print` takes 1 basic operation
# The runtime function

- Running time of `print_items` depends *only* on the size of input list (and not content)
	- i.e., `print_items` takes same amount of time on every list of length 100

> [!note] 
> *Definition.* Let `func` be an algorithm. For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we define the set $\mathcal{I}_{func, n}$ to be the set of allowed inputs to `func` of size $n$.
> - e.g., $\mathcal{I}_{print\_items,100}$ is the set of all lists of length 100

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every element of $\mathcal{I}_{print\_items, n}$ has the *same* runtime when passed to `print_items`.

> [!note] 
> *Definition.* Let  `func` be an algorithm whose runtime depends *only* on its  input size.
> We define the **running time function of `func`** as $RT_{func} : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$, where $RT_{func}(n)$ is equal to the running time of `func` when given an input of size $n$.

- The goal of a *running time analysis* for `func` is to find a function $f$ (typically a simple elementary function) such that $RT_{func} \in \Theta (f)$.
	- Technique
	    1. Identify blocks of code which can be counted as a single basic operation
	        - Don't depend on input size
	    2. Identify any loops in code, which cause basic operations to repeat
	        - Figure out how many times those loops run based on size of input
	    3. Use observations from previous two steps to come up with an expression for the number of basic operations used in algorithm
	        - i.e., find exact expression for $RT_{func}(n)$
	    4. Use properties of asymptotic notation to find an elementary function $f$ such that $RT_{func} \in \Theta(f(n))$

## Examples

```python
def print_items(lst: list) -> None:
	for item in lst:
		print(item)
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of the input list `lst`.
- Each iteration of the loop can be counted as a single operation
	- Nothing in it depends on the size of the input list
- So, running time depends on number of loop iterations
- Thus, total number of basic operations performed is $n$
$$RT_{print\_items}(n) = n \implies \texttt{print\_items}\in \Theta(n)$$

```python
def my_sum(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
	sum_so_far = 0
	for number in numbers:
		sum_so)far += number

	return sum_so_far
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of the input list `numbers`.
- Assignment statement `sum_so_far = 0` counts as 1 step
	- Running time does not depend on length of `numbers`
- For loop takes $n$ steps
	- Has $n$ iterations
	- Each iteration takes 1 step
- Return statement counts as 1 step
- Total number time is the sum:
	- $1 + n + 1 = n + 2$, which is $\Theta (n)$

### Nested Loops

```python
def print_sums(lst: list) -> None:
	for item1 in lst:
		for item2 in lst:
		print(item1 + item2)
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of `lst`
- The inner loop runs $n$ times
	- Once per item in `lst`
	- Each iteration is a single basic operation
- Outer loop runs $n$ times
	- Each of its iterations takes $n$ operations (inner loop)

$$\begin{align}
RT_{print\_{sums}(n)} &= \text{steps for the inner loop} \times \text{numbers of times inner loop is repeated} \\
&= n \times n \\
&= n^{2}
\end{align}$$
- Running time of this algorithm is $\Theta ({n^{2}})$
<div class="right-align"> <span class="math display">\blacksquare</span> </div>

> [!note] 
> The number of nested loops **is not** the exponent of $n$ in the Big-O expression
> - e.g., two levels of nested loops $\neq \Theta (n^{2})$ 

```python
def f(lst: list[int]) -> None:
	for item in lst:
		for i in range(0, 10):
			print(item + i)
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Inner loopâ€™s running time does not depend on the number of items in the input list
	- Single operation
- Outer loop runs $n$ times
	- Each iteration takes 1 step
- $\Theta (n)$
<div class="right-align"> <span class="math display">\blacksquare</span> </div>

### Loop iterations with changing costs

```python
def all_pairs(lst: list[int]) -> None:
	for i in range(0, len(lst)):
		for j in range(0, i):
			print(lst[i] + lst[j])
```

- Function has a nested loop
	- Inner loopâ€™s running time depends on the current value of `i`
		- which iteration of the outer loop we are on
	- â†’ Cannot calculate cost of the inner loop because it varies
- Instead, manually add up the cost of each iteration of the outer loop
	- which depends on the number of iterations of the inner loop
	- `j` goes from 0 to `i - 1` â†’ number of iterations of inner loop is `i`
		- Each iteration of inner loop is `i`

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of the input list.
- We start by analysing the running time of the inner loop for a *fixed* iteration of the outer loop, and a fixed value of $i$
	- Inner loop iterates $i$ times (for $j$ going from 0 to $i - 1$)
		- Each iteration takes one step (constant time)
			- List indexing is counted as constant time
		- â†’ cost of inner loop is $i$ steps for one iteration of the outer loop
	- Outer loop iterates $n$ times (for $i$ going from 0 to $n - 1$)
		- Cost of each iteration is not constant:
			- Cost of each iteration $i$ is $i$ steps
	- So, the cost of outer loop is the summation of $i$ from 0 to $n-1$

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = \frac{{n(n-1)}}{{2}}$$
- The total number of steps taken by `all_pairs` is $\frac{{n(n-1)}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} n^{2} - \frac{1}{2} n$
	- â†’ $\Theta (n^{2})$

# Analyzing code with multiple blocks

- Analyzing run time of two blocks of code executed in sequence (one after the other):
	- Add together their individual running times
- Sum theorems â†’ tells us that we can simply compute Theta expressions for the blocks individually
	- Then combine them by taking the fastest-growing one

```python
def combined(lst: list[int]) -> None:

	# Loop 1
	for item in lst:
		for i in range(10):
			print(item + i)

	# Loop 2
	for item1 in lst:
		for item2 in lst:
		print(item1 + item2)
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of `lst`
- First loop runs in time $\Theta (n)$
- Second loop runs in time $\Theta (n^{2})$
- By *Sum of Functions* theorem from [[100 ðŸ“’ Academia/CSC110/01 Course Notes/9 Analyzing Algorithm Running Time/9.3-4 Big-O, Omega, Theta; Asymptotic Growth and Limits\|9.3-4 Big-O, Omega, Theta; Asymptotic Growth and Limits]], we can conclude that `combined` runs in $\Theta (n^{2})$ (since $n \in \mathcal{O}(n^{2}$).
