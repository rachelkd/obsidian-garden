# Analyzing Algorithm Running Time

- basic operation
	- any block of code whose running time does not depend on the size of the input
		- includes all primitive language operations
			- e.g., most assignment statements, arithmetic calculations, list and string indexing
		- does **not** include function calls

```python
def print_items(lst: list) -> None:
	for item in lst:
		print(item)
```

- `print` takes 1 basic operation
# The runtime function

- Running time of `print_items` depends *only* on the size of input list (and not content)
	- i.e., `print_items` takes same amount of time on every list of length 100

> [!note] 
> *Definition.* Let `func` be an algorithm. For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we define the set $\mathcal{I}_{func, n}$ to be the set of allowed inputs to `func` of size $n$.
> - e.g., $\mathcal{I}_{print\_items,100}$ is the set of all lists of length 100

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every element of $\mathcal{I}_{print\_items, n}$ has the *same* runtime when passed to `print_items`.

> [!note] 
> *Definition.* Let  `func` be an algorithm whose runtime depends *only* on its  input size.
> We define the **running time function of `func`** as $RT_{func} : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$, where $RT_{func}(n)$ is equal to the running time of `func` when given an input of size $n$.

- The goal of a *running time analysis* for `func` is to find a function $f$ (typically a simple elementary function) such that $RT_{func} \in \Theta (f)$.
	- Technique
	    1. Identify blocks of code which can be counted as a single basic operation
	        - Don't depend on input size
	    2. Identify any loops in code, which cause basic operations to repeat
	        - Figure out how many times those loops run based on size of input
	    3. Use observations from previous two steps to come up with an expression for the number of basic operations used in algorithm
	        - i.e., find exact expression for $RT_{func}(n)$
	    4. Use properties of asymptotic notation to find an elementary function $f$ such that $RT_{func} \in \Theta(f(n))$

## Examples

```python
def print_items(lst: list) -> None:
	for item in lst:
		print(item)
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of the input list `lst`.
- Each iteration of the loop can be counted as a single operation
	- Nothing in it depends on the size of the input list
- So, running time depends on number of loop iterations
- Thus, total number of basic operations performed is $n$
$$RT_{print\_items}(n) = n \implies \texttt{print\_items}\in \Theta(n)$$

```python
def my_sum(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
	sum_so_far = 0
	for number in numbers:
		sum_so)far += number

	return sum_so_far
```

*Running time analysis.*
- Let $n$ be the length of the input list `numbers`.
- Assignment statement `sum_so_far = 0` counts as 1 step
	- Running time does not depend on length of `numbers`
- For loop takes $n$ steps
	- Has $n$ iterations
	- Each iteration takes 1 step
- Return statement counts as 1 step
- Total number time is the sum:
	- $1 + n + 1 = n + 2$, which is $\Theta (n)$
