# Mixing paint analogy

---

1. Alice and Bob agree on a random, not secret colour of paint to start with: yellow
	- Yellow
	- Decided publicly $\rightarrow$ eavesdroppers know this colour!
2. Alice and Bob both choose their own secret colour
	- They will never share with anyone
	- Alice picks red
	- Bob picks teal
3. They mix their secret colours with the shared yellow
	- Light orange for Alice
	- Blue for Bob
	- Done in secret
4. Exchange their mixed colours
	- Done publicly
	- There are three non secret colours: yellow, two mixtures
	- Two secret colours: Alice's red, Bob's teal
5. Alice mixes Bob's blue with her secret red; Bob mixes Alice's light orange with his secret teal
	- Both produce a brown
	- Assume colours mixtures are not easily separated $\rightarrow$ eavesdropper cannot determine what Alice and Bob's secret colours were, and therefore cannot mix them together with the yellow to produce the brown

# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

---

1. Alice chooses a prime number $p$ greater than two and an integer $g$ such that $2 \leq g \leq p - 1$. She sends both numbers $(p, g)$ to Bob.
2. Alice chooses a *secret* number $a \in \{1,2,...,p-1\}$
   She sends $A = g^{a} \;\%\; p$ to Bob
3. Bob chooses a *secret* number $b \in \{1,2,...,p - 1\}$
   He sends $B = g^{b} \;\%\; p$
4. Alice computes $k_{A} = B^{a} \;\%\; p$.
   Bob computes $k_{B} = A^{b} \;\%\; p$
5. $k_{A} = k_{B}$, which is the secret key $k$ that Alice and Bob share

## An Example

1. Alice starts by choosing $p = 23$ and $g = 2$.
   She sends both $p$ and $g$ to Bob.
2. Alice chooses a secret number $a = 5$.
   She sends $A = g^{a} \;\%\; p = 2^{5} \;\%\; 23 = 9$ to Bob.
3. Bob chooses a secret number $b = 14$.
   He sends $B = g^{b} \;\%\; p = 2^{14} \;\%\; 23 = 8$ to Alice.
4. Alice computes $k_{A} = B^{a} \;\%\; p = 8^{5} \;\%\; 23 = 16$.
   Bob computes $k_{B} = A^{b} \;\%\; p = 9^{14} \;\%\; 23 = 16$
5. $k_{A} = 16 = k_{B}$, and this forms secret key $k$

# Correctness: Are $k_{A}$ and $k_{B}$ always equal?

**Theorem.** (*Correctness of Diffie-Hellman key exchange*)
For all $p, g, a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}, (g^{b} \;\%\; p)^{a} \;\%\; p = (g^{a} \;\%\; p)^{b} \;\%\; p$.

- *Proof.*
	- Let $p, g, a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
	- Let $A = g^{a} \;\%\; p$.
	- Let $B = g^{b}\;\%\; p$.
	- We will prove that $B^{a} \;\%\; p = A^{b} \;\%\; p$.
	- First, we have that $A \equiv g^{a} \pmod{p}$ and $B \equiv g^{b} \pmod{p}$.
	- Then, $A^{b} \equiv (g^{a})^{b} \equiv g^{ab} \pmod{p}$
	- and $B^{a} \equiv (g^{b})^{a} \equiv g^{ba} \pmod{p}$.
	- Since $g^{ab} = g^{ba}$, we can conclude that $A^{b} \equiv B^{a} \pmod{p}$.
	- So, $A^{b}$ and $B^{a}$ must have the same remainder when divided by $p$,
	  $\implies B^{a} \;\%\; p = A^{b} \;\%\; p$.

# Security: How secret is the key?

---

- Eavesdropper has access to:
	- $p, g, g^{a} \;\%\; p, g^{b} \;\%\; p$

One approach an eavesdropper could take is compute $a$ and $b$ directly.

## Discrete logarithm problem

Given $p, g, y \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, find an $x \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $g^{x} \equiv y \pmod{p}$.
- We could implement a *brute-force* algorithm for solving this problem that tries all possible exponents $x \in \{0, 1, ..., p - 1\}$.
	- This is ***computationally inefficient*** when $p$ is extremely large.

There is no known *efficient* algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem.
- We say that the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is ***computationally secure***
	- Diffie-Hellman key exchanges tend to use primes on the order of $2^{2048} \approx 10^{617}$

```Python
def break_diffie_hellman(p: int, g: int, g_a: int, g_b: int) -> int:
    """Return the shared Diffie-Hellman secret key obtained from the eavesdropped information.

    Remember that the secret key is (g ** (a * b)) % p, where a and b are the
    secret exponents chosen by Alice and Bob.
    You'll need to find at least one of a and b to compute the secret key.

    Preconditions:
        - p, g, g_a, and g_b are the values exhanged between Alice and Bob
          in the Diffie-Hellman algorithm

    >>> p = 23
    >>> g = 2
    >>> g_a = 9  # g ** 5 % p
    >>> g_b = 8  # g ** 14 % p
    >>> break_diffie_hellman(p, g, g_a, g_b)  # g ** (5 * 14) % p
    16
    """
    # all possible exponents are prime and less than p
    for possible_a in range(2, p):
	    # check if g ** a is equivalent to g_a modulo p
	    if pow(g, possible_a, p) == g_a
		    return pow(g_b, possible_a, p)
```
