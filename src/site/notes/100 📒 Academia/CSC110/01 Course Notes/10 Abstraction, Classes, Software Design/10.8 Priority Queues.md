# The Priority Queue ADT

- Priority Queue ADT
	- Similar to [[10.7 Queues|queues]]
	- Every item has some measure of its “priority”
	- Items are removed in order of their priority; ties are broken in **FIFO** order
- Data:
	- collection of items and their priorities
- Operations:
	- determine whether the priority queue is empty
	- add an item with a priority (*enqueue*)
	- remove highest priority item (*dequeue*)

Note that priorities can be represented in different ways. In this case, largest integer = higher priorities.

## Public interface of a `PriorityQueue` class

```python
from typing import Any


class PriorityQueue:
    """A collection items that are be removed in priority order.

    When removing an item from the queue, the highest-priority item is the one
    that is removed.

    >>> pq = PriorityQueue()
    >>> pq.is_empty()
    True
    >>> pq.enqueue(1, 'hello')
    >>> pq.is_empty()
    False
    >>> pq.enqueue(5, 'goodbye')
    >>> pq.enqueue(2, 'hi')
    >>> pq.dequeue()
    'goodbye'
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new and empty priority queue."""

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this priority queue contains no items.
        """

    def enqueue(self, priority: int, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add the given item with the given priority to this priority queue.
        """

    def dequeue(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the item with the highest priority.

        Raise an EmptyPriorityQueueError when the priority queue is empty.
        """


class EmptyPriorityQueueError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when calling pop on an empty priority queue."""

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """Return a string representation of this error."""
        return 'You called dequeue on an empty priority queue.'
```

# List-based implementation of the Priority Queue ADT

Consider the following implementation of `PriorityQueue.__init__`, `PriorityQueue.is_empty`, and `PriorityQueue.dequeue`

```python
class PriorityQueue:
    """A queue of items that can be dequeued in priority order.

    When removing an item from the queue, the highest-priority item is the one
    that is removed.
    """
    # Private Instance Attributes:
    #   - _items: a list of the items in this priority queue
    _items: list[tuple[int, Any]]

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new and empty priority queue."""
        self._items = []

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        """Return whether this priority queue contains no items.
        """
        return self._items == []

    def dequeue(self) -> Any:
        """Remove and return the item with the highest priority.

        Raise an EmptyPriorityQueueError when the priority queue is empty.
        """
        if self.is_empty():
            raise EmptyPriorityQueueError
        else:
            _priority, item = self._items.pop()
            return item
```

For `PriorityQueue.enqueue`, we could:
1. Insert new priority and item into list, then sort by priority
	- This is inefficient
2. Start with a sorted list, search for the right index in the list to add new item
	- e.g., Suppose we want to insert `'hi'` with priority `5` into the priority queue with `self._items = [(1, 'a'), (4, 'b'), (6, 'c'), (10, 'd')]`
	- Would insert `(5, 'hi')` into index 2

## Implementation of `enqueue`

```python
class PriorityQueue:
    ...

    def enqueue(self, priority: int, item: Any) -> None:
        """Add the given item with the given priority to this priority queue.
        """
        i = 0
        while i < len(self._items) and self._items[i][0] < priority:
            # Loop invariant: all items in self._items[0:i]
            # have a lower priority than <priority>.
            i = i + 1

        self._items.insert(i, (priority, item))
```

## Running-time analysis

`PriorityQueue.dequeue` takes $\Theta (1)$ time

### `PriorityQueue.enqueue` analysis

**Worst-case analysis.**

Let $n$ be the current size of the priority queue (i.e., the length of `self._items`).
The first assignment statement (`i = 0`) takes 1 step.
The while loop:
- Takes _at most_ $n$ iterations, since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 at each iteration, and the loop must stop when `i` reaches $n$ (if it hasn’t stopped earlier).
- Each iteration takes 1 step, since the loop body is constant time.
- So in total the loop takes _at most_ $n \cdot 1 = n$ steps.

The last statement is a call to `list.insert`.
- `list.insert` takes at most $n$ steps.

Adding up these three parts, the total running time of this algorithm is at most $1 + n + n = 2n + 1$ steps, which is $\mathcal{O} (n)$.

**Second analysis (incorporating `i` in our analysis).**

Let $i$ be the index that the item is inserted into—or equivalently, the value of variable `i` when the while loop ends. Note that $0 \le i \le n$.

Then we can modify our above analysis as follows:

- We now know that the while loop takes _exactly_ $i$ iterations, for a total of $i$ steps (1 step per iteration).
- We know that calling `list.insert` on a list of length $n$ to insert an item at index $i$ takes $n-i$ steps.
- So the total running time is $1 + i + (n - i) = n + 1 \in \Theta (n)$.
