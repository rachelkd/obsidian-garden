# Linear Running Time

```python
def print_integers(n: int) -> None:
	for i in range(0, n):
		print(i)

print_integers(2)
print()
print_integers(4)
print()
print_integers(8)
```

- This loop iterates $n$ times
	- Calls `print` once per iteration
- Thus, `print_integers` has a ...
	- ***linear running time***
		- number of basic operations is a linear function of the input $n$

# Quadratic running time

```python
def print_pairs(n: int) -> None:
    """Print all combinations of pairs of the first n natural numbers."""
    for i in range(0, n):
        for j in range(0, n):
            print(i, j)
```

- There is a for loop that calls `print` $n$ times
- Outer loop (`i` repeats its body $n$)
	- Body in another loop which repeats its body $n$ times
- Inner loop takes $n$ calls to print each time it is executed
	- Executed $n$ times total
- `print` is called $n^{2}$ times in total
- `print_pairs` has a ...
	- ***quadratic running time***
		- number of basic operations is a quadratic function of input $n$

# Logarithmic running time

Consider a function that prints out the powers of two that are less than a positive integer $n$.

```python
import math


def print_powers_of_two(n: int) -> None:
	"""Print the powers of two that are less than n.
	
	Preconditions:
		- n > 0
	"""
	for i in range(0, math.ceil(math.log2(n))):
		print(2 ** i)
```

- The number of calls to `print` is $\lceil {\log_{2}{(n)}} \rceil$
	- $\implies$ Running time of `print_powers_of_two` is *approximately*, but not exactly $\lceil \log_{2}{(n)} \rceil$
	- We say that `print_powers_of_two` has a ...

# Constant running time

```python
def print_ten(n: int) -> None:
	"""Print n ten times.
	"""
	for i in range(0, 10):
		print(n)
```

- For loop iterates 10 times $\implies$ `print` is called 10 times *regardless of $n$*.
- We say that `print_ten` has a ...
	- ***constant running time***
		- number of basic operations is independent to the input size
