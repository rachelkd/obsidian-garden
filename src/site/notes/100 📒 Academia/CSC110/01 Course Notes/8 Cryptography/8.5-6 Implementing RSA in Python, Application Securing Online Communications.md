### Encryption

> - Ciphertext is another number $c = m^{e} \;\%\; n$

# HTTPS and the Transport Layer Security Protocol

- HTTPS
	- Communication protocol
	- Consists of two parts:
	  1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
	     - Governs the format of the data being exchanged between computer and the server
	  2. **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**
	     - Governs how data (formatted by HTTP) is encrypted during communication process

> [!note]
> - HTTP allows your computer to communicate with servers around the world
> - TLS provides security and makes sure communications cannot be "snooped" by an eavesdropper

## TLS Protocol (simplified)

Client (computer) initiates a request to the server (e.g., website)
   - e.g., when you type URL into web browser and press "Enter"
Then,
1. When client initiates request,
    - Server sends a "proof of identity" that client has connected with the intended server, which client verifies
        - This communication is *not encrypted*
2. Then,
    - Client and server perform Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to establish a shared secret key
        - This communication is also *not encrypted*
3. All remaining communication ...
    - Actual website data
    - is encrypted using an agreed-upon symmetric-key cryptosystem
        - e.g., a [[100 ðŸ“’ Academia/CSC110/01 Course Notes/8 Cryptography/8.2 The One-Time Pad and Perfect Secrecy#Stream ciphers\|stream cipher]]

# Why symmetric-key encryption?

- Public-key cryptosystems are significantly *slower* than symmetric-key counterparts
	- RSA relies on modular exponentiation
	- Modern symmetric-key cryptosystems use faster operations to encrypt and decrypt
		- Operations typically act on swapping or combining individual bytes in computer memory

# Who am I connected to?

- First two steps of TLS protocol are "setup" steps for the actual communication of data between the client and server
	- unencrypted

**To verify that the server we intend to speak with is *actually* who they say they are:**
- Digital signatures
	- Every public-key cryptosystem (incl. RSA) can implement two additional algorithms to:
	    1. Sign message using private key
	    2. Verify a signature using the public key
	-  Used in the first two steps in TLS protocol

## Establishing identity: digital certificates

- First step: server sends a "proof of identity"
	- Server sends a ***digital certificate***
		- contains identifying info for the server
			- e.g., domain (e.g., `www.google.com`), organization name (e.g., "Google LLC"), and its *public key*
- Certificate includes digital signature of a *certificate authority*
	- Organization whose purpose is to issue digital certificates to website domains and verify the identities of the operators of each those domains
- When client "verifies" digital certificate provided by the server,
	- client is verifying the digital signature provided by the certificate authority, using the authority's public key

## Maintaining identity during Diffie-Hellman

- Server *signs all messages* it sends during Diffie-Hellman algorithm
	- Client can verify that message came from the intended server
- Relies on client knowing server's public key
	- which it gets from the digital certificate
- Digital signature
	- allows client to consistently verify that it is communicating with the server
	- verify that messages have not been tampered
