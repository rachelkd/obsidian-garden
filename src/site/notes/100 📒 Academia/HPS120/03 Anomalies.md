# Anomalies
**What is a scientific anomaly?**

- A big deviation from what you’ve expected; something that goes against trends; some result we get that does not fit the theory and not because we are bad at science

**Is every data point we can’t explain an anomaly?**

- Treat anomalies as an elevated word: special category of things that don’t fit the trend line or expectations you might have

# Expectations

- We call something an anomaly when it challenges well-established expectations about what should happen
    - Anomalies exist *relative* to some paradigm, framework, other set of theories or way of seeing the word
- Calling something an anomaly is kind of an achievement!
    - For something to *be* an anomaly means we have some well-established set of expectations, and not only does this NOT fit our expectations, but it actively challenges our expectations
        - This is going to push against the established framework
        - Life-blood of scientific advancement — you don’t get these big leaps without anomalies

> [!important] Science advertises itself at being so great at...
>  **changing the deep structure of its theories over time**.
> - without an anomaly, you cannot do that.
> - e.g., Particle physicists are worried about the lack of anomalies.

# Outliers

- Outliers are also data points that do not fit the trend line
    - extremely common feature of raw data
- Outliers do not typically bring a scientific study to a screeching halt
- Most common way to deal with outliers is to remove the data point(s)
- Is that a reasonable thing to do?
    - How do we know an outlier is not an anomaly?
    - If you rerun the experiment and those data points do not show up again, then maybe it is not an anomaly.
        - It has to be reproducible.
    - If one person has psychic powers, that would not change science much: you cannot do a study on ONE guy.
    - If you’re spending time trying to figure out the outlier/anomaly, then that is time you are spending not working on whatever you got the grant for.
- There’s no time to investigate every avenue
- This is why we have paradigms to massively narrow down the number of things to investigate
    - to make it even possible to being investigation


> [!note] 
> Anomalies are going to be the thing where we say: “Oh, there’s something interesting going on here. I’m going to spend some time on it”

# Falsifications

- Karl Popper’s demarcation criteria between science and pseudo-science:
- Popper’s falsification criterion:
    - If your theory is not such that it can possibly be proven wrong by observational evidence, then it isn’t a scientific theory
    - Meant to rule out theories like “invisible gremlins who do nothing are everywhere”
    - There’s no observation to prove you wrong; it’s not a study-able subject

This relates to the **[[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/02 Pure and Applied Science#Mertonian Norms \|Mertonian Norms]]**: disinterestedness.

We have this image of the noble scientist:
- “This data point cannot be squared with my theory. I guess I must be wrong.”
    - Popper does not say to act like that.
    - People do not act like that at the first sign of trouble and give up their theories.

# Anomalies and Retrocognition

- Lightman and Gingerich (1992) describe a number of cases of anomalies that weren’t recognized as important until after a reasonable explanation was developed for them
    - They call this ***retrocognition***

# The Flatness Problem

- It is well established that the universe is expanding
    - The distance between the Earth and sun is not expanding because we’re stuck together due to gravity
    - Anything that isn’t stuck together with gravity seems to be moving apart
- The more distant a galaxy is from us, the faster it tends to be moving away from us
- This is one of the most basic observations which supports the big bang model of the cosmos

## The Flatness Problem, information.

- There’s a certain amount of energy in the push that is moving things away from each other
    - Kinetic energy
- There’s also a pull: gravitational energy
    - (every object is attracted to every other object by gravity)
- There’s some ratio: kinetic to gravitational energy
- Ratio dictates the future of the whole universe
    - If kinetic >>> gravitational: everything continues to drift off into seperateness
    - If gravitational >>> kinetic: everything collapses back into itself
- **The Flatness Problem**
    - Ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy looks suspiciously close to 1, where they are perfectly balanced
        - Is that weird? Why would anything think that is an anomaly — there is only one universe.

Some explanations for the Flatness Problem:

- God loves us!
    - If we did not have this balance of kinetic and gravitational energy, we would not be able to exist:
        - If gravitational energy was way stronger than kinetic, we would crunch again before stars could develop or burn out and explode
        - If kinetic >>> gravity, everything gets blasted out immediately so far apart

# Inflationary Period

There is a viable proposal to solve this thing.

- In the early universe ($10^{-5}$ seconds after the Big Bang), there was this inflationary period where space expands INSANELY fast
    - then, it settles down to this (still fast) pace the universe is expanding now
- Everything starts from a singularity (homogenous)
    - Things are clumpy — clump together in galaxies, but also fairly evenly spread apart
        - How do you explain that?

In this period, there are quantum fluctuations of quantum mechanics — wiggly, wobbly at different scales and that gets blown up to the scale of galaxies during the inflationary period.

- Overall structure of universe is determined by tiny, tiny fluctuations that were very rapidly expanded
    - Independent feature of our universe
    - But this inflationary period also solves our flatness problem!

Inflationary period washed out whatever the initial conditions were for kinetic energy, and sets it very low (close to 1).

- Then, slowly rises as kinetic energy gets drained away by gravitational energy

# Was this a problem?

- Lightman and Gingerich draw out attention to this example because before this explanation was developed, people tended not to see flatness as a problem
    - Why is the ratio close to 1? Why not?

**Some people said “No.”**

> According to Geller, “the flatness problem has always seemed to me like an argument of religion rather than an argument of science. Because the universe is one realization. It’s one system. So how can you talk about a priori probabilities?” (691)
> 

*A priori* means “before observation.” Before you’ve gone and looked, how do you know what the ratio is supposed to be. How do you say that this is an unlikely ratio before you’ve gone and looked at the ratio — and once you look at the ratio, that is the ratio!

This is not a scientific anomaly for Geller. 

Neither does Wagoner think so:

> Wagoner says, “I don’t think any of these arguments [for or for against the naturalness of $\Omega$ being so close to one] are relevant because I think they are philosophical. Let observation decide what $\Omega$ is.” (691)
> 

“Why are the initial conditions the way they are? I don’t know — they are!”

# Expectations, again

<aside>
💡 The argument Geller and Wagoner make in these quotations is that there wasn’t an anomaly here, because there was no scientific reason to have expectations about the value of $\Omega$.

- You can’t have an anomaly without **************************************************************************************some set of expectations for it to violate!**************************************************************************************
</aside>

“Why is a starburst the way it is?” is pretty much the same as asking “Why did it happen at all?”

- Interesting question, but not the kind of thing that science deals with

There was no model telling us what the Big Bang should look like — so what could even be an anomaly?

But now, we have a mathematical model of the inflationary period that ****does**** explain the “anomaly”

- Now, it is a scientific question
    - We have a model of inflation that makes a number of predictions that are checkable against evidence
        - The exact structure of the distribution of galaxies in the universe is predicted by the inflationary model

Inflationary model provides a set of expectations

- Now, something can appear as an anomaly relative to those expectations
- Now, something can be expected or unexpected

# Retrocognition

- The three stages of retrocognition
    1. A fact of nature is observed in the context of an existing explanatory framework.
        - We got the Big Bang model — looks like the parameters (how fast things are moving, how much stuff there is) are just variables you plug in
    2. The fact does not have a logical explanation in the existing framework, but is nevertheless unquestioned or ignored, or accepted as a given property of the world, or simply postulated to be true.
        - We do this with the Big Bang itself: why was there a Big Bang? Nobody knows.
    3. A new theory or model is advanced in which the observed fact now has a compelling and reasoned explanation. At the same time, the fact is retroactively recognized as an anomaly in the context of the old theory or model.
        - An anomaly is an achievement.
        - You bring something to life as an anomaly by setting up some standard or framework or expectations that could make it look strange.
    
    (pp. 693-694)
    

## Another (simplified) example

**Geocentric model of the solar system.**

Ptolemy produced a mathematical version of this which made fairly precise predictions about where the planets would appear in the sky.

- This image contains something that is impossible in Ptolemy’s system and in reality!
    - Mercury is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun
        - That never happens


- Mercury and Venus stayed close to the sun because of a complex system of epicycles, smaller circles that the planets rotated around in their larger orbits.
- For Ptolemy, it’s just sheer coincidence that you never see Venus high in the sky in the middle of the night.
    - Is this an anomaly?

- Copernicus gives an explanation for this:
    - Mercury and Venus orbit closer to the sun than us
- Which means, they can never be on the opposite side as the sun is

## The example of continental fit

People used to think that it was weird the coasts of the Americas and Africa and Europe look like they kind of fit together.

- Then, we found out that the continents rest on tectonic plates that move around
    - and they used to be connected!

We get an explanation of this weird thing:

- That’s why they used to fit together — because they did fit together.

Once a model exists to explain it, people go: “We should’ve seen it all along. We should’ve known…” which leads us to:

# Confirmation bias

- A cynical person may attribute this all to ***confirmation bias***
    - tendency of people to pay more attention to information which confirms their hypothesis than other information

# Scientific conservatism

> [!note]
> Lightman and Gingerich attribute the phenomenon of retrocognition large to *scientific conservatism*
- Scientists tend not to want to give up ideas that have worked pretty well
    - You’ve spent your career within a certain way of seeing the world; you got a bunch of awards for your work on that idea; you have a grant currently under review — you might not be too excited to give it up
        - Does not fit well with our “heroic” picture from the “disinterested scientist” that we get from our [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/02 Pure and Applied Science#Mertonian Norms\|Mertonian Norms]], following the truth wherever it leads

---

**Galileo was okay with some anomalies**, re: stellar parallax

- Even produced *ad hoc* hypotheses if his critics insisted on an explanation
> [!note]
> *Ad hoc* means "for this particular purpose", suggesting that confirmation bias provides an explanation tailored to the specific situation rather than a broader scientific principle.


- He did not look at any anomaly and say “Time for a new theory!”
- You cannot just give up the minute an anomaly shows up
    - even if it is not an outlier — it is a regular, repeatable, signal in the data that your theory cannot explain

# The necessity of paradigms

Lightman and Gingerich show that anomalies only get attention, traction, and foothold once an alternate framework exists which can accommodate them

- i.e., until a new way of seeing anomalies is available
- Scientists are not splitting up with their current paradigms unless there is somebody new…

---

**Science cannot operate outside of any paradigms**

- And yeah, paradigms will blind us to some things that are important
    - but there is no view from nowhere that avoids all blind spots
- There isn’t such a thing for us tiny, finite beings
- We need paradigms
    - to keep the community on the same page
    - to tell us what is important or interesting

This is why we NEED anomalies

- Those paradigms are going to be partial
- They’re going to bias us in certain ways
    - where some things are interesting, some things are not
- That means we are going to miss stuff, and that stuff could be important

One in a while, those paradigms are going to need to be shifted and updated.

- That’s how science lives up to its promise of being ever-renewing, ever-improving self-critical beliefs

# Planck’s Principle

Famous physicist Max Planck said:

> A new scientific truth does not triumph by converting its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.
> 

Call this “Planck’s Principle”

- Demographic framing of scientific conservatism
    - The older you get, the more conservative you will become
    - Conservatism is concentrated in the older people, and less in the young
- As a principle, it has the virtue of being very cynical
    - good marketing strategy:
        - “You can always make people think you’re smart by being more cynical than them”

It is also a ***testable hypothesis***:

“Old people refuse to accept new ideas, and young people do”

- e.g., continental shift
    - Messeri (1988):
        - studied how the age of scientists correlated with their willingness to accept the fancy new theory of plate tectonics
        - found a negative correlation:
            - older scientists were actually faster to get onboard with continental drift than younger scientist
                - contr. to Planck’s Principle
- e.g., “Does science advance one funeral at a time?”
    - More recent study shows some effect on publication patterns when a star scientist dies
    - Found that when a prominent scientist dies prematurely, their collaborators publish less, and non-collaborators publish more
        - Doesn’t mean that star scientist was ruining careers of anybody outside of their orthodox
        - Doesn’t show that scientists become more conservative as they age
        - DOES show that when someone is very prominent in a field, they take up space
            - They attract funding, attention
    - When a prominent scientist dies, there is more space in the discipline for other people doing other projects
        - Those are not necessarily contradictory projects; they might not disagree — just energy, time, attention tends to accumulate around star scientists

# Paradigms and Attention

Another way of thinking about a paradigm is as a way of regulating what issues get scientific time, resources, and attention.

- How much time and energy are you going to spend on something (relating back to the discussion about outliers)?
- What is worth studying? What would count as an anomaly? What counts as signal (something you pay attention to), and what counts as noise (something you filter out)?

# But what happened to the truth?

- Resource allocation problems?
    - Really? This is how to think about science? Who gets the money?
- Frameworks and expectations?
- This sounds like sociology. That sounds like science is a *social construction*.
    - I thought that science was supposed to be about objective truth!

That’s why we will be talking about realism and anti-realism:

- Does science get the truth? Or does it get something useful and predictable?
