# Why do you trust your doctor?

- I trust... 
	- the medical science to have the right answers
	- the institution of doctors
	- this person in particular
<br>
- Would you rather have somebody that is fresh out of medical school
	- Trained out of the latest and greatest version of medical science
- Or someone who has trained for years and years
- Statistically, you are better off with the medical student

# Intentional Ignorance

- Reading this week (Kaptchuk, 1998) offers a history of placebo controls

**How do we get from "I trust this person because they've been practicing for a long time" to "I trust this person because they have been the gold standard for medicine for a long time?"**

- Historians as a discipline strongly focus on description, not judgement
	- History tries to break up what seems so obvious to us
- It seems like Kaptchuk has views on the situation, but Prof. doesn't think so: he is reading with no judgement

# Franz Mesmer (1734 - 1815)

- German doctor
	- wrote his dissertation on how the moon and planets influenced human health
- This wasn't astrology
	- instead, an attempt to extend Newton's (relatively new) theory of gravity
- Tried to influence the "tides" in a patient's body by having them swallow some iron, and attaching magnets to them
- Tried to create internal tides in his patients
	- Patient had a case of hysteria (when women do not do what they are told)
	- She reported some relief from her hysteria
- Decided that it could not have just been the magnets
	- It was something about him personally; **he had some special property** to move the fluids in a person around to provide relief
		- *"animal magnetism"*

# Group Mesmerism

- Mesmer tried to get mainstream scientific acceptance for his views
	- Moved to Paris in 1781
	- It did not work; they did not buy it
	- Started a private practice for treating people – almost exclusively women
- It became a kind of fad
	- People were strongly divided on whether it was real or not:
		- Is animal magnetism real, or is he a scam artist?

# A Royal Commission

Louis the 16th called a *Royal commission* to decide whether there was anything to this
- **This commission did some of the first blind tests on record.**
	- Trials involved literally blindfolding subjects
#todo

## Features of this blind test
- Medical establishment facing something from outside
	- Mesmer has a PhD, but his theory is coming from outside

# Homeopathy
- Developed in the very late 1700s, early 1800s by **Samuel Hahnemann**
- Basic idea of homeopathy
	- small amounts of a substance which cause a symptom can cure a disease which also causes that symptom
	- e.g., if you have a fever, a tiny amount of a substance which causes increase in body temperature will cure your disease
- ‘Simila similibus curentur’
	- slogan: ‘like cures like’
<br>
- Hahnemann also believed that when you introduce an ingredient into water, the water retains some of the "spiritual vital essence" of it
	- Dilute water $\implies$ supposed to actually increase the power of the medicine
- Homeopathic remedies are typically so dilute that it’s unlikely that even a single molecule of the original ingredient is present

# Armand Trousseau

- French doctor
- Practised standard medicine
	- Took it upon himself to test homeopathic cures
- Did placebo trials:
	- Gave people inert pills, but told them it was homeopathic remedies
- Found that the bread pills worked about as well as the homeopathic ones
- But, *this was* ***single blind***.
	- Trousseau knew which pills were which
	- Involved no careful statistical methods:
		- He knew what it looked like to get better
- His method:
	1. rounded up about 10 patients
	2. lied to them about what they were receiving
	3. watched what happened

# The Brown-Séquard Elixir

- Another example which doctors felt the need to apply rigorous placebo-controlled trials:
	- was an extract of animal testicles, from monkeys, dogs, bulls, or guinea pigs
- Brown-Sequard claimed that injecting this extract would bring back youth and vitality to older men

- *Dr. M.G. Variot* found the claims made in the popular press about the elixir to be fanciful
	- The press talked about the elixir being the “fountain of youth” and the “Alchemists dream”
- The placebo trial:
	- *Variot* tried the extract on three elderly men,
		- reported feeling great
	- Then tried injecting just saline (but telling the men it was the elixir) on two more men
		- reported no change

# Placebo Trials #todo

# Polio Vaccine

> [!note] 
> The first time we saw large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials on which careful statistics were applied were the **polio vaccine** (1950s).

- In 1955, the American Medical Association was willing to print the opinion that the evaluation of drugs "should not be kept in the hand of the general practitioner and not be on the basis of experiments"
	- "Trust your doctors"
- But, we also saw a massive, highly publicized placebo-controlled trial for the Polio vaccine
	- in the 1950s
## Francis Field Trial
- Largest medical experiment in history up until that point
	- Took place in 1956
	- 1.8M children were involved
- Method:
	- 440,000 were given the vaccine
	- 210,000 were given a placebo
	- Rest were used as a control group

> [!note]
> Placebo-controlled trials are now the standard

# Placebos

- "Placebo" is latin for "I shall please"
- There is really no effect with a placebo
	- If a doctor has an effective treatment, they will give it to you
		- If they do not, they might give you something to calm you down, make you happy, and go home.
		- They might give you a placebo, just to maintain your trust in the system
			- But you're lying to the patient: controversial

> "[Placebo] is ordinarily taken to mean a procedure undertaken to gratify the patient’s desire for active intervention, but which is understood by the doctor to be inert and useless." 
> 
> Houston (1938) The Doctor Himself as a Therapeutic Agent. *Annals of Internal Medicine* 11:416-425



> “But above all he must entertain no misconceptions ; he must admit to himself the grounds on which he is making the concession [of giving a placebo]. In general these grounds are not of a high scientific or ethical order. The doctor is afraid of losing the case. Let us note here the remarkable contrast between the attitude of the house surgeon and that of the young practitioner. In the former capacity he was only too pleased when a troublesome patient decided to leave and thus free a bed for a more satisfactory case ; as a practitioner he is likely to have quite other feelings in the matter.”
> 
> Crichton-Miller, H. (1932). Primitive Man and the Modern Patient. British medical journal, 2(3739), 430.

# The Placebo Effect
- There is some debate about the placebo effect
<br>
- **Common take about placebos:**
	> “Indeed, experimental studies have shown that placebo, as well as being particularly effective for the relief of pain and inflammation, can, for example, speed wound healing, boost immune responses to infection, cure angina, prevent asthma, lift depression, and even help fight cancer”
	> 
	> Humphrey, N. (2002). Great expectations: The evolutionary psychology of faith healing and the placebo effect. In Psychology at the Turn of the Millennium, Volume 2 (pp. 241-259). Psychology Press.
	
- People used to think that placebos were just used to *please* the patient
	- After some time did people think that maybe there is some effect to placebos
- Your belief alters your perception of your experience
	- Your expectations of a thing alter the way that you perceive it
	- e.g., rating pain: 
		- You ask a patient to rate their pain – it is only accessible to the patient. 
- But, "fighting cancer"?
	- That is not a subjective *self-report*
	- There is a clear data for cancer

# Increasing Effective Placebos
![Pasted image 20231019142244.png|500](/img/user/Files/Pasted%20image%2020231019142244.png)
Tuttle, A. H., Tohyama, S., Ramsay, T., Kimmelman, J., Schweinhardt, P., Bennett, G. J., & Mogil, J. S. (2015). Increasing placebo responses over time in US clinical trials of neuropathic pain. _Pain_, _156_(12), 2616-2626.

- Oddly, the size of placebo effects in some categories seems to be increasing
- Tuttle et. al found a steady increase in placebo responses in trials of painkillers for neuropathic pain
- But weirdly, only in America The same trend did not appear in Europe or Asia
- Maybe they see the initial "I'm feeling better," which makes them happier, which makes them feel better

# Open Label Trials

- They tell people, "Here's a placebo. This pill does nothing. Take it."
	- It *still* helps people
- Solution for the people against placebos ("you're lying to people"):
	- You can tell the patients that it is a placebo, and it will still work.

**Placebo effects vs. placebo response**
- Placebo effects are an effect on the individual due to the placebo treatment
- Placebo responses include everything that happens in the *placebo arm*
	- including, just naturally getting better, regression to the mean, and the *"Hawthorne effect"*

## Hawthorne Effect
- 1920s, has to do with the doctor-patient relationship
- A series of studies were done at Hawthorne Works, a factory that made electrical appliances
- Wanted to experiment if increasing the lighting increased worker productivity
	- Lighting increased $\rightarrow$ worker productivity increased
	- Lighting decreased $\rightarrow$ ALSO increased
- Worker productivity decreased only when the study stopped...

> [!note] Hawthorne Effect
> People change their behaviour in response to being observed.

# Placebo vs. No Treatment

Some meta-analyses have found only modest placebo effects across studies that compare it to no-treatment.
- *Did* find some effects in things like pain and phobias

# A defense of placebo effects

- Finniess et al. addresses these meta-studies
	- argue that placebos do much better in studies that are specifically about placebo mechanisms
- Claim that this is likely because they are paying closer attention to the language and presentation of the placebo
	- more closely mimicking clinical practice
<br>
- There is a real difference between being in a clinical trial and being in a doctor's office
	- If you're specifically studying the placebo effect, you are a lot more careful about the presentation of the drug
		- Much more specific instructions on how to phrase, how to act

# The medical significance of being nice

- Put something on their skin that will give it irritation
	- Give something that is supposed to relieve the irritation
- Placebo effect only has an effect when there is a nice, positive, friendly provider.
