# Science Wars

In the 1990s, there was a wave of criticism that science was solely objective:

- **Critics**
    - Science is a social activity, performed by people, who live in a culture
    - Claimed that social factors shape the kinds of questions science asks, and what kind of evidence it takes to be sufficient to answer them
- **Counter-critics**
    - Science is an objective process
    - Culture plays a role when things go wrong

# Sociology of Scientific Knowledge

Why did alchemists think they could turn lead into gold?

- The answer is NOT because they could.
- Everyone agrees to look at the sociology, psychology, culture of someone in medieval Europe
    - How could alchemists think that they could turn lead into gold?
    - ‚Äúbecause of these cultural traditions, social organization, etc.‚Äù

**When something is clearly wrong, then explaining it sociologically is fine.**

Why do people think Baboons form dominance hierarchies?

- It is pretty clear that they do this.
    - Application of sociological and psychological analyses is/was controversial
- So, the answer to some was: ***because they do ‚Äî science works!***

> ‚ÄúOnly in the 1960s did primatologists begin questioning stereotypes of male aggression and dominance and begin looking seriously at female behaviour. They began studying the significance of female bonding through matrilineal networks and analyzing female sexual assertiveness, female social strategies, female cognitive skills, and female competition. Today, in a turnabout from the 1960s, conventional wisdom on baboons recognizes that females provide social stability, while males move from group to group.‚Äù

# Relativism(s)

## Sandra Harding

- Cultural critic of science
    - What we need to start looking at is the cultural, sociological factors that go into producing scientific knowledge

> ‚ÄúThis is not to say that science 'makes up' its results of research, or that science is 'nothing but politics by other means,' of course, as a familiar internalist epistemological approaches invariably interpret such findings‚Äù (Harding 1998, p.126)
> 
- Harding is NOT saying science is all made up or that science is just politics by other means
    - She IS saying that there is an important social story to be told in science
        - e.g., feminist or post-colonial perspective

## Bala

- Focussed on the post-colonial aspect of this debate
- Post-modern critics say that modern science is a product of Europe and the west, encoding its assumptions and neglecting the perspectives of other cultures
    - We‚Äôve overemphasized it as the true objective way of understanding the world
    - Underemphasized various culturally-bound ways of knowing and bodies of knowledge
- Modernists say: No.
    - Science is the correct way of gathering knowledge $\rightarrow$ it is culturally neutral

**Bala wants to reject both of these ways of thinking.**

- If you read modern historians of science, they largely agree that science emerges from huge, centuries/millennia-long multi-cultural conversations (rather than Europe)
    - Scientific revolution largely happens in Europe, BUT the stuff that goes into that revolution comes from all over the world

> [!note]
> This is called the ***dialogical view of the history of science***.

He wants to replace the Eurocentric view with the *dialogical view*.

**Eurocentric view:**

- Ancient Greece $\rightarrow$ ??? $\rightarrow$ Renaissance Europe $\rightarrow$ Now
    - This version of the story is actually an invention from Renaissance Europe to cover their tracks:
    - They were taking a lot of stuff from (mostly) the Islamic world; didn‚Äôt want to cite their sources
        - Europe was doing a lot of crusades; relationship between Europe and Islamic world was not good

# Dialogical History of Science

In the 90s, some people said that science is not completely objective

- Worried that science is fundamentally tied to its European origins

Other people said, the fact that it has got Euro. origins does not matter that much

> [!note] **Bala argues that the origins are not all that European.**
> - Pieces that go into modern science come from all over the world
> - Developing knowledge is a long, slow process that took many years:
>     - came from multiple people
>     - happened all over the place

So, there are three arguments:

1. Science is European
2. Sure it is, but that‚Äôs fine
3. Bala: No, science is not fundamentally European ‚Äî it was invented by everybody

# Could there have been an Ancient Greek Copernicus

Angle: Copernicus is kind of a symbol for the beginning of the scientific revolution; the beginning or birth of modern science.

- Most famously said the Earth is not the centre of the solar system

**What did Copernicus have at his disposal that maybe someone in Ancient Greece would not have?**

- Bala asks: Could there have been an Ancient Greek Copernicus?
    - There were Ancient Greeks that suggested maybe the Earth goes around the sun
    - They could not have built the Copernican model for a bunch of reasons:
        - Reasons are apart of the story of the global history of science
- What did Copernicus have access to that Ancient Greeks did not have access to?
    - E.g., a bunch of intellectual work from India, China, and the Middle East

# Advances in Mathematics

One thing Copernicus had was much better math.

- He had much more advanced trigonometry than Ptolemy (the guy Copernicus sort of overthrows)

This trigonometry came from India. To get a flavour for what higher education looked like in India, consider‚Ä¶

## Nelanda University (5th to 11th century CE)

- In its time, possibly the biggest institution of higher learning in the world
- Around 10,000 students, 2,000 teachers
- Could get an education in Hindu, Buddhist philosophy, and medicine, math, logic, and natural science (Europeans called this natural philosophy)
    - Would have Mesopotamian astrological/astronomical tradition
- Greek astronomical texts also made it to India
    - prior to the opening of Nelanda
    - would have been there and studied
- Knowledge is being collected and collated.
    - Buddhist philosophy is coming from India and China
    - Greek, Mesopotamia

## Aryabhata (476 - 550 CE)

- Probably the most famous mathematician/astronomer of early Indian natural philosophy
- Head of Nelanda for a while
- Made a number of significant contributions
    - Argued that the movement of the stars at night (it looks like the stars are slowly travelling overhead) should be understood in the terms of the Earth spinning.
        - Model was still geocentric (representing the Earth as the centre)
        - At least suggested that the Earth spins on its axis (not orbits, though)
    - Calculated the size of the Earth
        - like Eratosthenes
        - Aryabhata‚Äôs figure was off by 2% vs. Eratosthenes
    - Provided the first recorded recorded use of the $\sin$ function
	    - although, precursors to trig. can be found in other cultures as well.

# Brahmagupta (598 - 668 CE)

- Contributed massive advances in trig.
	- how to find intermediate values given a trig. table
- Provided the first clear rules for working with <u>zero</u> as a number
	- Zero had been a placeholder before this:
		- Ancient Mesopotamia: `101` had a mark for the tens column, but you could not multiply it or treat it as a number

# Bhaskara II (1114 - 1185 CE)

- Developed a version of differential calculus
	- hundreds of years before it was produced in the West
- Worked out how to apply differential calculus to trigonometric functions

> [!note]
> Indian mathematics is proceeding along very well.
> - making massive innovations that then
> - get moved around the world; exported

# An Improved Numeral System

From the Indian subcontinent:
- We get a very handy system of numerals
	- Developed over centuries
- By the time of Brahmagupta, we got *similar numerals representing 0 to 9, with a place system and decimals*.

Europe was using roman numerals.
- Not very easy to do trigonometry with roman numerals

# Sylvester II (c. 946 - 12 May 1003)

- Sylvester II is credited with *bringing* what we call **Arabic numerals** to Europe from Spain
	- It is referred as the *Arabic* numeral system and not Hindu numeral system because <u>it was imported to Europe from the Arabic world</u>.
- Sylvester II grew up poor and got shipped to Spain to study
	- Why Spain?

# Islamic Caliphates

- Sylvester

# Tutorial

## Test

Critical evaluation of the term: why is it significant? Why is it relevant?

- Make a connection of the relevance to this term ‚Äî own interpretation (personal connection?)
    - Even if TA/prof disagrees, you can still earn the whole mark
    - Can disagree that the term is relevant or important

## Essay

Re: realism and anti-realism prompt

<aside>
üí° With reference to the arguments presented in the reading by Okasha, give an argument for
either realism or anti-realism with respect to electrons.
