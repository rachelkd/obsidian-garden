# Week 6 - Global history of science

See [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/06 Global history of science\|global history of science]].

### Science wars
- **What**
	- Science wars is a debate about the objectivity and reliability of scientific knowledge between scientists and sociologists. In the 1990s, there was a wave of criticism towards the idea that science was solely objective. Critics argued that science is a social activity performed by people who live in a culture. Social factors shape the kinds of questions science asks and what kind of evidence is required to answer such questions. Counter-critics argued that science is an objective process; however, cultural factors do play a role when things go wrong.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about global history of science.
- **Why**
	- Cultural critic of science Sandra Harding highlights the importance of observing cultural and sociological factors that go into producing scientific knowledge. This does not mean that science is made up, but that there is an important social story to be told in science – for example, from a feminist or post-colonial perspective. 
	- One might critique science as being a product of Europe and the West, thus, neglecting other cultural perspectives. This Eurocentric view is incorrect. Rather, scientific revolution is the product of multicultural conversations (see [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/Key Terms 2#^d9da96\|dialogical view of the history of science]]).
- *From tutorial:* 
	- sociology; a collective debate in the late 20th century
	- scientists (mainly physicists and biologists) against sociologists
	- objectivity and reliability of scientific knowledge
	- social factors (e.g., cultural)
	- Whether scientific knowledge is universal or not
		- question the objectivity of science
### Dialogical view of the history of science
{ #d9da96}


- **What**
	- The dialogical view of the history of science is a perspective that rejects both the post-modern critics and modernists in the science wars debate. Post-modern critics argue that social factors affect science, whereas modernists argue that science is objective. Therefore, there are three arguments: science is European, science is European and that is okay, and the third points to the dialogical view. The dialogical view argues that the science is not fundamentally European; pieces that go into modern science come from all over the world.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about the global history of science.
- **Why**
	- The scientific revolution under the dialogical view mirrors the Islamic Caliphates' methods of conquering and synthesizing knowledge from everywhere they interacted with. Modern science was made possible by millennia of conversations between various civilizations – the scientific revolution was a global synthetic project. To minimize science as fundamentally European is to misunderstand what the scientific revolution is.

### Translation movement
- **What**
	- The Translation Movement was a massive project organized and funded by the Islamic Caliphs who conquered numerous regions. This occurred around the time of 750 CE. Conquerers collected and translated as much knowledge as possible into Arabic, making it a language of learning. They synthesized knowledge from the people they conquered and studied such knowledge in their language.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about the global history of science.
- **Why**
	- The Translation Movement laid the intellectual foundations for later scientific advances during the European Renaissance by spreading knowledge of ideas, methods and technologies from other cultures, which European scientists like Copernicus later built upon.
	- Additionally, the scientific revolution is another example of acquiring then synthesizing information in their own language. The existence of movable type from China made its way to Europe, which made reproducing knowledge vastly easier and more reliable. This comparison depicts science as a global project rather than a product of Europe and the West as presented in the Eurocentric view.

# Week 7 - Methodological developments

See [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/07 Methodological developments\|methodological developments]].

### Placebo
- **What**
	- Placebo is latin for "I shall please." A placebo is an inert or ineffective treatment given to patients to help manage their expectations or symptoms without any real medical benefit. 
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about methodological developments. Over time, scientists and doctors questioned whether their methods did what they claimed to do.
- **Why**
	- There is a debate about giving patients placebos. Doctors might give placebos to their patients to maintain a good doctor-patient relationship and keep their trust in the system. If a patient visits their doctor, and the doctor has no real treatment for the patient's symptoms, then they might not visit the doctor when something that is treatable occurs. However, the other side argues that doctors are lying to their patients and taking their money.
	- Perhaps, the answer to this debate lies in the effectiveness of placebo responses. Experimental studies have suggested that placebos do have some sort of effect: they can relieve pain, speed wound healing, and help fight cancer. A solution to "lying" to patients is open label trails, where people are told that they are taking a placebo. The placebo effect still appears in these trials.

### Placebo controlled trials (randomized controlled trials)
- **What**
	- Placebo controlled trials are clinical studies that involve comparing an intervention to a placebo. Participants in the trials are placed in three different arms: the intervention arm receives the treatment, the placebo arm receives an inert treatment to determine if the placebo effect is strong enough to help people get better, and the no intervention arm acts as a control group to test if people spontaneously get better on their own.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about methodological developments.
- **Why**
	- Placebo controlled trials became important to rigorously test medical claims and interventions. Early examples (like the trails of Franz Mesmer's "animal magnetism" and the Brown-Séquard Elixir) showed the value of blinding and control groups. Later trials like the polio vaccine trials in the 1950s established placebo-controlled double-blind trials as the gold standard approach. This allows researchers to distinguish the actual effects of a treatment from other factors like the placebo effect, natural recovery, or biases.
### Hawthorne Effect
- **What**
	- Placebo responses in a placebo controlled trial are signals in the data. One potential placebo response is the Hawthorne Effect. Researchers wanted to determine whether increasing lightning increased worker productivity. They observed that worker productivity increased when the lighting increased and also decreased. This suggested that the lighting changes did not have an effect. They coined the Hawthorne Effect — as the study was done at a electrical appliance factory called Hawthorne Works — which is the phenomenon that people change their behaviour when they are being observed.
- **Where**
	- This key term appeared in the methodological developments lecture.
- **Why**
	- The Hawthorne Effect is significant because it shows that placebo effects and other behavioural changes can occur simply due to participation in research, not just the experimental treatment. This discovery was important for the development of controlled trials and the need for placebo-controlled, double-blind studies to distinguish real treatment effects from placebo responses or the Hawthorne effect. A double-blind study means that neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants are in the placebo, intervention, or control arm to reduce bias. The Hawthorne Effect highlights the need for controls to account for these non-specific effects when evaluating medical treatments.

# Week 8 - Peer Review

See [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/08 Peer Review\|peer review]].
### Peer Review
- **What**
	- Peer review is the evaluation of scientific work by experts in the same field. Journals have reviewers look over these submitted papers to either accept, revise and resubmit, or reject them. This process aims to ensure quality and credibility in scientific research.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about peer review.
- **Why**
	- There are two non-mutually-exclusive perspectives towards peer review: the first being the classical view that peer review differentiates science from other practices that are unscientific, and the modern view that claims peer review is the weakest link in scientific knowledge production.
	- While peer review is necessary in some form to maintain the quality of science and scientific journals, the process is deeply flawed.
		- It is slow; reviewers are volunteers and do not gain any credibility for peer review. 
		- Additionally, peer review is biased: first to the type of research and second to the researchers.
			- For example, it is unlikely that they will publish replication studies because replication studies do not claim anything particularly interesting that make people want to read the journal. Furthermore, reviewers might reject a paper because they think the conclusion is implausible. Their judgement is based off their Bayesian priors, which makes it difficult for groundbreaking discoveries to be published.
	- One potential solution to this flawed system is to shift the scientific community towards Open Science; however, it will be difficult to break the current cultural inertia.
### Preprint archive
- **What**
	- Preprint archives are a form of open publishing, which is apart of the open science philosophy. Preprint archives are moderated servers for scientists to publish their manuscripts. This is a form of [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/08 Peer Review#^8955e8\|open science]]: the public is able to access these papers.
- **Where**
	- This appeared in the lecture about peer review as a suggestion to improve the deeply flawed peer review process.
- **Why**
	- Preprint archives allow scientists to communicate with each other outside the traditional publishing model. One flaw of the peer review system is that it is slow. Preprint archives are a faster way to share papers, though its moderation process does not evaluate the paper for quality. This seems to suggest that fraudulent papers can be shared under the disguise that their conclusions are plausible; however, combination of preprint archives with open commentary can work to reduce that. Thus, the success of open publishing depends on the readers' abilities to properly judge preprint archive material.
### Open Commentary
- **What**
	- Open commentary is a form of [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/08 Peer Review#^8955e8\|open science]] that gives scientists a platform to publicly comment on scientific papers. One open commentary platform is PubPeer, which is an online community, but also a Chrome extension.
- **Where**
	- This term was introduced in the lecture about peer review as a suggestion to combat the flawed peer review process. 
- **Why**
	- Open commentary platforms facilitate discussion among the scientific community, which opposes the slow process of peer review. Any qualified person can leave insightful comments, providing different perspectives on the paper rather than the traditional two or three reviewers and editors in a journal.
	- Additionally, open commentary works with preprint archives to help provide context, caveats, and suggestions for authors and readers without making an overall determination on the paper. That is the job of peer review in traditional publishing.
	- Open commentary also points out scientific fraud in papers, which is more prevalent in the field than some may assume. Open comments can highlight areas of photo manipulation, which could potentially nullify the paper's interpretation(s).

# Week 9 - Fraud #todo

See [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/09 Fraud\|Fraud]].

### Image manipulation
- **What**
	- Image manipulation is the purposeful altering of data and observations that are then used in manuscripts or scientific publications. Examples of image manipulation in scientific papers include duplicate images — either exact, rotated, or flipped — and duplicate blots across different experimental conditions. Image manipulation misrepresents the actual data or results; it is a form of scientific fraud. 
- **Where**
	- Thus, this term appeared in the lecture about scientific fraud.
- **Why**
	- Although image manipulation deceives and distorts, the response from publishers is not as dramatic as one may expect. This suggests that some may not consider image manipulation to be a serious form of scientific misconduct. Perhaps, this perspective is systemic: the scientific paper convention is to depict a linear and straight-forward narrative, which saves readers’ time. Readers want to know the facts. An experiment is messy, but each trial reveals more about the experimental method. An argument for image manipulation is that it is done for clarity, just like editing writing; it does not affect the underlying science in the conclusion. To consider image manipulation as a serious form of scientific misconduct, there must be some systemic change to scientific publication.
### Scientific misconduct
- **What**
	- Scientific misconduct is behaviour that intentionally compromises the integrity of the scientific process. This includes, but is not limited to, falsifying or fabricating data, results, or methodology. An example of scientific misconduct is Hwang Woo-Suk’s stem cell research, where Hwang not only fabricated data, but committed several ethics violations to obtain embryos.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about scientific fraud.
- **Why**
	- Although scientific misconduct is serious, it is hard to discern and measure. Scientists who commit scientific misconduct want to hide it. The severity of scientific misconduct changes if it is done purposefully, knowingly, and/or recklessly. Sovacool describes three narratives to explain scientific misconduct. The individual narrative portrays scientific misconduct as an individual problem: a particular scientist fails to adhere to the Mertonian norms (disinterestedness). The institutional narrative argues that scientific misconduct is the product of an institution’s values. Institutions employ the scientist(s) who commit misconduct and have incentives to commit misconduct (e.g., funding, recognition, and prestige). The structural narrative views misconduct as a systemic issue. Scientific reform depends on which narrative is correct.
### Institutional narratives of misconduct
- **What**
	- The institutional narrative of scientific misconduct views misconduct as the failure of an institution. In this narrative, scientists are influenced by the institutions that support them. Rather than a “bad” scientist who breaks the monolithic Mertonian norms, this narrative suggests that the values of a scientist reflect the values of an institution (i.e., professors, students, research assistants, and deans). These values differ within disciplines and laboratories.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about scientific fraud.
- **Why**
	- The institutional narrative of misconduct suggests that neither scientists nor institutions can be trusted to stop misconduct. Sovacool explains in his article that universities have incentives to commit misconduct: undetected falsification or fabrication of data can lead to greater funding and prestige. If scientists are motivated by their institution to publish high-impact studies, then they have incentives to commit misconduct. Institutions drive scientists to embellish findings, and unnoticed misconduct benefits the institution.
	- If the problem is institutional, one way of reform is to employ whistleblower protections. Whistleblower protections prevent informers from losing their status, which could make researchers more inclined to report scientific misconduct. This changes the incentives of an institution. Institutions want to penalize misconduct as its publicizing reflects poorly on the institution.
