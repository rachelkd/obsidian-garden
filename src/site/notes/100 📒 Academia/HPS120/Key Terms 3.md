### P-hacking
- **What**
	- P-hacking is a technique in academic research where researchers selectively choose analyses that produce significant results rather than the best analysis plan. 
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about meta-analysis.
- **Why**
	- P-hacking can lead to the publication of false positive results, which hinders scientific progress and can have a negative impact on future research in the field. It misuses data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant when there is no real underlying effect.
	- Norman et. al found a suspiciously high number of studies just under the significant threshold 0.05. This suggests that p-hacking occurs somewhat often and bypasses the peer review process. This poses the question: is scientific literature poisoned by research that is not representative of the truth?
	- As science promises itself to be self-correcting, the answer is hopefully no. One particular study is not enough to be considered proof. Replication labs will expose the validity of research results. Additionally, researchers conduct meta-studies that look at a collection of individual studies can reveal trends in the literature. Optimistically, false positives can be ruled out by opposing such trends.
### Case-Control Studies
- **What**
	- A case-control study is a type of observational study that compares two existing groups differing in outcome based on some supposed causal attribute. The group of individuals who have the outcome of interest (cases) is compared to a group of individuals who do not have the outcome of interest (controls). The researcher looks at factors to identify if some exposure is found more commonly in the cases than in the controls.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about meta-analysis.
- **Why**
	- There was a debate about the validity of case-control studies determining causal connections. Some argued that due to their retrospective nature, case-control studies can only establish a correlation between factors and outcomes but cannot establish causation.
	- However, Sir Austin Bradford Hillâ€™s case-control study on smoking and lung cancer provides solid evidence that smoking does cause lung cancer; Hill provided a causal story based on scientific literature that explained the link between smoking and lung cancer. Case-control studies with the Hill strategy â€” a causal inference â€” are able to establish causation.
### Meta-Analysis
- **Where**
	- The term, meta-analysis, appeared in the lecture about meta-analysis.
- **What**
	- A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple individual studies to derive a cumulative estimate closest to the unknown common truth based on the trends in the literature.
	- It is possible for scientific fraud and dishonest research to pervade scientific literature. A meta-analysis can help to reduce the impact of false positives by pooling the results of multiple studies and providing a more reliable estimate of the effect size. 
- **Why**
	- However, there is an argument that meta-studies are malleable. Meta-studies do not constrain researchers sufficiently to come up with just one conclusion: researchers make choices about which studies to include, how to measure the outcomes of such studies, and how to weigh various studies. There is no principled rule for these choices. These choices open the gate to bias. There have been cases of different meta-studies on similar topics with contradictory conclusions, and analysts who receive funding from the tobacco industry are more likely to conclude that passive smoking has no adverse health effects. If researchers have an agenda, they can conduct a meta-study that supports their hypothesis.
	- One potential solution to mitigate bias is to include a causal inference in meta-analyses. There should be some qualitative data from the literature in addition to the quantitative data in the meta-analysis.

### Honest hype
- **Why**
	- The term, â€œhonest hype,â€œ appeared in the lecture about science communications. It has become a part of the job of a scientist to communicate and promote their work. However, making something widely understood requires simplification, and that might distort the science presented.
