# Hwang Woo-Suk

- The case of Hwang Woo-Suk
	- South Korean biotechnologist
	- 2004 and 2005
{ #96acde}

		- Published two articles in Science
		- Reported creating human embryonic stem cells by cloning

## Embryonic Stem Cells

- Political hot topic in the early 2000s
- Hundred of types of cells in an adult human body
	- But embryos start from just a few
- These stem cells are *pluripotent*
	- Can turn into any cell type in the adult body
- Scientific interest in these cells comes from the hypothesis that they could assist in healing many types of disease
	- Serious injuries (e.g., healing spinal injuries)

So, being able to clone stem cells would be huge.
### Cloning and Stem Cells

However, you cannot take any kind of stem cell and stick them in a body:
- Stem cells contain DNA
	- DNA is specific to a person
	- If DNA in cell does not match DNA in immune system,
		- The body will reject the stem cell and attack it as a foreign invader
	- Pluripotent ‚Üí dream would be to turn into any cell largely based on context cues
		- e.g., putting your stem cell into bone would turn the cell into bone

- Hwang's lab reported:
	- Being able to make *patient specific* pluripotent stem-cell lines
		- Patient specific ‚Üí body does not reject it
- Method:
	- Take an egg, fertilize them ‚Üí grow into embryos
	- Put those embryos back into body ‚Üí In vitro fertilization
		- Process produces a bunch of excess embryos
	- Scientists wanted to use these excess embryos
- Claim:
	- Could suck out the DNA in embryos (i.e., remove the genetic material)
	- Put in patient specific DNA from an adult
	- Pass electricity through it to stimulate cell to take on that DNA ‚Üí reproduce it on its own basis
	- Resulting stem cells would be able to heal a wide variety of problems
		- *without* dangers of rejection by patients immune system

## U.S. Stem Cell Research Ban

- Early 2000s
	- Very public debate about research using embryonic stem cells
		- Main concern was that embryos have the same moral status as adults
		- Use in scientific research is unethical
		- Connected to the abortion debate: largely the religious right argued that any fertilized egg is a person ‚Üí should not be experimented on

## Celebrity Scientist

- Hwang was something of a celebrity scientist:
	- Discovery claims were typically made via press conferences
		- Became very famous in Korea
	- Made frequent media appearances, met the president, etc.
- There was a big economic crash in early 2000s:
	- South Korea was making a lot of computer chips
		- Dot-com crash
			- ‚ÄúShare prices suddenly went down as hundreds of companies doing business on the Internet failed or lost most of the value of their shares‚Äù (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023)
	- South Korea decided to make a play in bio-tech
		- Hwang‚Äôs lab was one of the stars in the bio-tech industry
- Only thing left to do was publish
	- Scientific community thought that his claims were cool, but wanted to see the data

## Science Papers

- Published [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/09 Fraud#^96acde\|two papers]]
1. ‚ÄúEvidence of a Pluripotent Human Embryonic Stem Cell Line Derived from a Cloned Blastocyst‚Äù
	- Big if true: If this is true, we‚Äôve got an avenue for incredibly interesting and promising biotech research
	  <br>
	- Two issues flagged in the current version of this paper
		- Marked with notice of correction and a retraction
	- **In the ‚ÄúCorrections and Clarifications Erratum‚Äù:**
		- > ‚ÄúContrary to the statements in the second paragraph of text and first paragraph of the supporting online material, which indicated that there was no financial payment to oocyte and cumulus cell donors, some oocyte donors were financially compensated for their donation with a payment of approximately U.S. $1400.‚Äú
			- Oocytes are the eggs ‚Üí ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt pay these people for these eggs,‚Äù but they did
			- Ethics violation (if that was all there was to it ‚Äî it‚Äôs much worse than this)
				- It is a draining process to undergo IVF with potential long-term consequences (might be infertile afterwards)
		- > [!warning] Hwang was found to have <u>pressured his post-docs into donating their own eggs for the study</u>, as well as <u>buying eggs on the black market</u>
			- Reports after indicated that he was kind of a tyrant
	- **In the retraction:**
		- Paper has been retracted (though not because of the ethics violations)
		- Discovered that Hwang had been faking his data
			- Never accomplished what he claimed ‚Äî just made it up

## Whistleblowers

- Misconduct was ultimately uncovered due to *whistlerblowers* from within Hwang‚Äôs lab
	- One researcher made a post on the website of a Korean investigative news program
		- Program contacted him and his wife who worked at the lab
	- First thread that gets pulled to uncover serious ethical violations and faking data

# How Prevalent is Misconduct?

- Hwang‚Äôs scandal was a high profile one (celebrity scientist)
	- Made international headlines
- Turns out to be pretty hard to define ‚Äúscientific misconduct‚Äù
	- And hard to measure
		- People doing it want to hide it

# Image Manipulation

![image_manipulation_1.png|undefined](/img/user/Files/03%20HPS120/image_manipulation_1.png)
<span style="color: grey">Treated and untreated in group A are pixel-for-pixel identical.</span>

- The chances of this is so astronomically small
	- Closest certainty you can get is that this is not going to happen by accident
- This passed peer review ‚Üí in the literature

![image_manipulation_2.png|undefined](/img/user/Files/03%20HPS120/image_manipulation_2.png)
<span style="color: grey">All but one are the same blots in different orientations.</span>

- Response from publishers is not always as dramatic or timely as one may expect
	- Nothing happened to the person who published this
	- > [!note]
	  Suggests that many do not consider image manipulation to be a serious form of scientific misconduct
- Argument for image manipulation:
	- Image manipulation is more for aesthetics of the article rather than proving what researchers said they did
		- Does not affect the underlying science behind it
	- You and your lab run 50 runs of this experiment ‚Äî none of them run particularly properly, but each time you learn more about the experimental system
		- e.g., we need more magnesium here, we should have set the microscope to [‚Ä¶]
	- Virtually never do you report the failure and mess of a run
		- What you present is the successful run of the experiment; how you would have run it if you did it from the start
	- Published literature is for the clean version
		- It is all edited in the same way the image is edited for clarity
		- As a do-er for science, you might want to know how it is made

![image_manipulation_3.png|undefined](/img/user/Files/03%20HPS120/image_manipulation_3.png)
<span style="color: grey">Pilato, L. A., & Michno, M. J. (1994). Advanced composite materials. Springer Science & Business Media.</span>

- Was retracted, but also made it through peer-review

![image_manipulation_4.png|undefined](/img/user/Files/03%20HPS120/image_manipulation_4.png)
<span style="color: gray">Ninov, V., Gregorich, K. E., Loveland, W., Ghiorso, A., Hoffman, D. C., Lee, D. M., ... & Wilk, P. A. (1999). Observation of Superheavy Nuclei Produced in the Reaction of K 86 r with P 208 b. Physical Review Letters, 83(6), 1104.</span>

- First claim of Element 118
	- Getting a priority claim for discovering an element is a big deal
- 1999
	- Research group at Berkeley was trying to synthesize a super heavy element
	- Hypothesized an element to exist:
		- Hypothetical island of stability out beyond the elements that can exist for more than one second
		- A bunch of space that elements cannot exist
		- And a hypothetical island where elements can exist for a short period (maybe a second or less)
			- Claimed to have found this ‚Äúisland‚Äù: Element 118
	- Attempts appeared to be successful, and they published
- Other labs could not replicate their result
	- After this, Berkeley team went back and tried again to confirm
	- Showed up again ‚Äî only when one lead scientist *Victor Ninov* was doing the analysis
		- First run: Ninov was the only person who could operate the computer program
		- Second run of attempted replications: Other people had learned how to use the software
- Eventually concluded that Ninov altered the files (i.e., fabricated the data)
	- despite never admitting to any wrongdoing
- Also example of a high profile case
	- **But also a case of science working properly**
- Fraud was uncovered because everyone involved did their due diligence
	- except Ninov, of course
- There is a level of trust baked into this process
	- Everybody trusted Ninov to run ‚ÄúGoosey‚Äù software
	- To eliminate this fraud process, you would have to turn science into a police state ‚Üí brings science to a halt in some sense
- This also went through peer review
	- Peer review is fundamentally unsuited to detecting this kind of fraud
		- Reviewers do not get access to raw data, certainly do not look over your shoulder when you run the lab

# Three Stories About Misconduct

- Drawing on scholarship on the Hwang case, *Sovacool* identifies three types of narrative used to explain scientific misconduct:
	1. Individual
	2. Institutional
	3. Ethical

## Individual

- Media largely portrayed Hwang case as one driven by his personal failings:
	- He was a bad person who did bad things ‚Üí *his* badness explains explains the scientific misconduct
	- Could say he failed to follow the [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/02 Pure and Applied Science#Mertonian Norms\|Mertonian norms]]
		- More interested in personal success than truth
- If the individual level explanation is the right one, then *self-regulation by science* seems to be the right answer

If science can regulate itself, then you can leave it to the experts:
- Experts in a field are the best positioned to distinguish misconduct from simple bad practice
- e.g., if this scientist is a known fraudster, then we are not going to give them grants, jobs ‚Üí self-regulate
	- Leave it to the culture within a discipline
		- the best place to train new scientists to practice science virtuously

### Ethics Education

- If the individual narrative is right, an important remedy to scientific misconduct is to include ethics training in science education
	- **However, Sovacool is skeptical**

> ‚ÄúA study of 172 University of Texas students enrolled in a ‚Äúresponsible conduct of research‚Äù course, for example, found ‚Äúno significant change‚Äù in attitudes after training, says Elizabeth Heitman of the University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston. The finding is consistent with what Steneckhas seen, including a 1996 study that found that people who had gone through a training course were actually more willing to grant ‚Äúhonorary authorship‚Äù to colleagues who had not performed research than were those who had not been trained.‚Äù

Marshall, E. (2000). Scientific misconduct: how prevalent is fraud? That‚Äôs a million dollar question. Science, 290 (5497), 1662‚Äì1663.

- Ethics courses do not seem to change and improve people‚Äôs behaviours

## Institutional

- Institutional narratives of scientific misconduct place blame on the:
	- pressures and incentives that shape scientific careers
	- > [!note]
	  If the only way to get/keep a job as a scientist is constantly publishing high impact studies, there is significant pressure to get impressive results one way or the other

> [!note]
> Institutions *differ* in terms of what kinds of pressure they put on scientists
> - Some specific institutions have too much pressure, too many expectations, and not enough regulation to prevent scientific misconduct


- Case of Hwang
	- Under extraordinary pressure to produce blockbuster results
	- Bring back South Korea in revolutionary biotechnology developments

If this is the problem, then you might make some reforms like ***whistleblower protections***.
- This is what happened in the Hwang case:
	- Was not peer review that pointed out flaws in the manuscript
	- It was somebody in the lab reporting it

### Whistleblower Protections

> ‚ÄúA 1995 report commissioned by the U.S. Office of Research Integrity described the kinds of retaliation self reported by a sample of those who brought allegations of scientific misconduct. The results are discouraging. Almost 70% of 68 survey respondents reported a negative consequence due to their having blown the whistle. The range of measures taken against them included, for example, loss of position, denial of promotion or salary increase, reduction in research or staff support, pressure to drop allegations, and threat of a lawsuit.‚Äù

Frankel, M. S. (2000). Scientific Societies as Sentinels of Responsible Research Conduct (44535D). Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, 224(4), 216-219. p.218

- Find some way to make sure people who report bad actors are not punished
	- Whistleblowers are not popular:
		- The person they are reporting is generally bringing in grants, prestige to university, making news, etc.
	- If the people who are blowing the whistle can be silenced, then that brings prestige to you, the scientist
- e.g., If you get a notice that someone is reporting you for scientific misconduct, then maybe they do not work there anymore (i.e., they are removed from the project)
- **Whistleblower protections disable that**
	- **One way of keeping an institution honest**
	- Prevent the institution from becoming a place that is friendly to scientific misconduct ‚Üí Institution itself has a strong motivation to deal with whistleblowing
	- Incentives for the structure of the institution change if you have whistleblower protection

### Criminal Prosecution

- It is not a crime to simply commit scientific misconduct
	- Some people have argued that it should be a crime
		- e.g., misleading investors by faking data of antibiotics you are selling
			- Redman, B. K., & Caplan, A. L. (2005). Off with their heads: The need to criminalize some forms of scientific misconduct. The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics, 33(2), 345-348.
			- Redman and Caplan argue that this is a crime
			- Investors could be investing solely on the fact that recent scientific data says the drug is safe and effective
- The worst thing that could happen in scientific fraud is:
	- Lose your job
	- Hwang was sent to jail for his ethical violations, but that rarely happens
- What does criminality for scientific misconduct do at the institutional level?
	- Imagine ‚ÄúUofT scientist goes to jail for falsifying research‚Äù
		- Really bad look; president of UofT has no power to keep them out of jail -‚Äì entirely different system of authority
	- This would change how the institution handles cases of scientific misconduct

## Systemic

- Systemic narrative suggests:
	- Problem is not with individuals, or specific institutions, but with the *basic, whole structure of scientific research*
	- Is NOT that science is corrupt at every point
		- but that the problems that do exist are so deep and widespread that they require deep reform to address
	- You cannot localize the issue in one individual or one institution

### Epistemic Cultures

- Sovacool emphasizes that the systemic view does not claim that science is the same at all points
	- Uses the notion of ‚Äúepistemic cultures‚Äù from Knorr-Cetina to do this
- A given discipline, or even lab, has its own ***epistemic culture***:
	- Your individual lab has ways of behaving:
		- How long do they say: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good enough‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a little odd ‚Äî we should look deeper into that‚Äù
	- What are the cognitive resources that are devoted to various epistemic tasks?
	- How much pressure does the principal investigator put on the researchers working for them to produce good results?
	- How wide is the scope of investigation?
	- Are you allowed to tinker and explore?
		- Do people have time to explore side-projects?
			- e.g., some research projects are incredibly rigid, whereas others might be more open to interesting anomalies that appear in the project
			- This is a question of epistemic culture
	- Is creativity encouraged?

> [!note]
> Systemic narrative is not to say that it is a problem with everyone
> - means that there is not just one problem to solve
> 	- There is something in the air
> - Not everyone involved is exacerating the problem
> - But the problem is systemic


### The Cleaned Up Research Report

> ‚ÄúWriting a paper‚Äù wrote Nobel Laureate Fran√ßois Jacob‚Äîone of the authors of the Nature paper‚Äî‚Äúis to substitute order for the disorder and agitation that animate life in the laboratory‚Ä¶.To replace the real order of events and discoveries by what appears as the logical order, the one that should have been followed if the conclusions were known from the start‚Äù (The Everyday Practice of Science, F. Grinnell, p.5-6)

- Jacob is not excusing scientific misconduct
	- Pointing out that the convention in writing a scientific paper is to present a linear, straight-forward, sensible, logical narrative
- You write a journal article as though you knew what the answer was
- Example for Sovacool of a kind of systematic misrepresentation of what science is like
	- Misrepresentation of the everyday practice of science that is ubiquitous 
		- Textbooks present facts as though they do not have a history; they do not have a story about how they became known
- Systemic misrepresentation of how to do science
	- Important to save us all time and energy ‚Äî do not want many pages in a journal article; just want the facts

### Overemphasis on Publication

- Another systemic factor is the (seemingly increasing) pressure to publish
	- ‚Üí leads to people gaming the system
		- e.g., adding people to the authors list that did not contribute, publishing bits and pieces of research as separate articles that should have been just one

### Competition over Cooperation

- Sovacool also notes that the incentives to compete, rather than cooperate are widespread in modern science
	- e.g., particle physicists did not release their results for fear of being scooped ‚Üí failure of [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/02 Pure and Applied Science#Mertonian Norms\|Mertonian norms]]
	- Competition for grant money, credit, jobs, etc. are all very common

### Systemic Solutions

- ‚Äú‚Ä¶the pattern of government and university support, the way that students and subordinates are treated, the very way that certain values are emphasized in modern science must be reformed.‚Äù (Sovacool, p. 281)
	- Ok, but how though?
	- Sovacool does not give any specific policy changes
