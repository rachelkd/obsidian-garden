# Science Wars

In the 1990s, there was a wave of criticism that science was solely objective:

- **Critics**
    - Science is a social activity, performed by people, who live in a culture
    - Claimed that social factors shape the kinds of questions science asks, and what kind of evidence it takes to be sufficient to answer them
- **Counter-critics**
    - Science is an objective process
    - Culture plays a role when things go wrong

# Sociology of Scientific Knowledge

Why did alchemists think they could turn lead into gold?

- The answer is NOT because they could.
- Everyone agrees to look at the sociology, psychology, culture of someone in medieval Europe
    - How could alchemists think that they could turn lead into gold?
    - “because of these cultural traditions, social organization, etc.”

**When something is clearly wrong, then explaining it sociologically is fine.**

---

Why do people think Baboons form dominance hierarchies?

- It is pretty clear that they do this.
    - Application of sociological and psychological analyses is/was controversial
- So, the answer to some was: ***because they do — science works!***

> “Only in the 1960s did primatologists begin questioning stereotypes of male aggression and dominance and begin looking seriously at female behaviour. They began studying the significance of female bonding through matrilineal networks and analyzing female sexual assertiveness, female social strategies, female cognitive skills, and female competition. Today, in a turnabout from the 1960s, conventional wisdom on baboons recognizes that females provide social stability, while males move from group to group.”

Schiebinger, L. (2000). Has feminism changed science?.

# Relativism(s)

## Sandra Harding

- Cultural critic of science
    - What we need to start looking at is the cultural, sociological factors that go into producing scientific knowledge

> “This is not to say that science 'makes up' its results of research, or that science is 'nothing but politics by other means,' of course, as a familiar internalist epistemological approaches invariably interpret such findings” (Harding 1998, p.126)
> 
- Harding is NOT saying science is all made up or that science is just politics by other means
    - She IS saying that there is an important social story to be told in science
        - e.g., feminist or post-colonial perspective

## Bala

- Focussed on the post-colonial aspect of this debate
- Post-modern critics say that modern science is a product of Europe and the west, encoding its assumptions and neglecting the perspectives of other cultures
    - We’ve overemphasized it as the true objective way of understanding the world
    - Underemphasized various culturally-bound ways of knowing and bodies of knowledge
- Modernists say: No.
    - Science is the correct way of gathering knowledge $\rightarrow$ it is culturally neutral

**Bala wants to reject both of these ways of thinking.**

- If you read modern historians of science, they largely agree that science emerges from huge, centuries/millennia-long multi-cultural conversations (rather than Europe)
    - Scientific revolution largely happens in Europe, BUT the stuff that goes into that revolution comes from all over the world

> [!note]
> This is called the ***dialogical view of the history of science***.

He wants to replace the Eurocentric view with the *dialogical view*.

**Eurocentric view:**

- Ancient Greece $\rightarrow$ ??? $\rightarrow$ Renaissance Europe $\rightarrow$ Now
    - This version of the story is actually an invention from Renaissance Europe to cover their tracks:
    - They were taking a lot of stuff from (mostly) the Islamic world; didn’t want to cite their sources
        - Europe was doing a lot of crusades; relationship between Europe and Islamic world was not good

# Dialogical History of Science

In the 90s, some people said that science is not completely objective

- Worried that science is fundamentally tied to its European origins

Other people said, the fact that it has got Euro. origins does not matter that much

> [!note] **Bala argues that the origins are not all that European.**
> - Pieces that go into modern science come from all over the world
> - Developing knowledge is a long, slow process that took many years:
>     - came from multiple people
>     - happened all over the place

So, there are three arguments:

1. Science is European
2. Sure it is, but that’s fine
3. Bala: No, science is not fundamentally European — it was invented by everybody

# Could there have been an Ancient Greek Copernicus

Angle: Copernicus is kind of a symbol for the beginning of the scientific revolution; the beginning or birth of modern science.

- Most famously said the Earth is not the centre of the solar system

**What did Copernicus have at his disposal that maybe someone in Ancient Greece would not have?**

- Bala asks: Could there have been an Ancient Greek Copernicus?
    - There were Ancient Greeks that suggested maybe the Earth goes around the sun
    - They could not have built the Copernican model for a bunch of reasons:
        - Reasons are apart of the story of the global history of science
- What did Copernicus have access to that Ancient Greeks did not have access to?
    - E.g., a bunch of intellectual work from India, China, and the Middle East

# Advances in Mathematics

One thing Copernicus had was much better math.

- He had much more advanced trigonometry than Ptolemy (the guy Copernicus sort of overthrows)

This trigonometry came from India. To get a flavour for what higher education looked like in India, consider…

## Nelanda University (5th to 11th century CE)

- In its time, possibly the biggest institution of higher learning in the world
- Around 10,000 students, 2,000 teachers
- Could get an education in Hindu, Buddhist philosophy, and medicine, math, logic, and natural science (Europeans called this natural philosophy)
    - Would have Mesopotamian astrological/astronomical tradition
- Greek astronomical texts also made it to India
    - prior to the opening of Nelanda
    - would have been there and studied
- Knowledge is being collected and collated.
    - Buddhist philosophy is coming from India and China
    - Greek, Mesopotamia

## Aryabhata (476 - 550 CE)

- Probably the most famous mathematician/astronomer of early Indian natural philosophy
- Head of Nelanda for a while
- Made a number of significant contributions
    - Argued that the movement of the stars at night (it looks like the stars are slowly travelling overhead) should be understood in the terms of the Earth spinning.
        - Model was still geocentric (representing the Earth as the centre)
        - At least suggested that the Earth spins on its axis (not orbits, though)
    - Calculated the size of the Earth
        - like Eratosthenes
        - Aryabhata’s figure was off by 2% vs. Eratosthenes
    - Provided the first recorded recorded use of the $\sin$ function
	    - although, precursors to trig. can be found in other cultures as well.

# Brahmagupta (598 - 668 CE)

- Contributed massive advances in trig.
	- how to find intermediate values given a trig. table
- Provided the first clear rules for working with <u>zero</u> as a number
	- Zero had been a placeholder before this:
		- Ancient Mesopotamia: `101` had a mark for the tens column, but you could not multiply it or treat it as a number

# Bhaskara II (1114 - 1185 CE)

- Developed a version of differential calculus
	- hundreds of years before it was produced in the West
- Worked out how to apply differential calculus to trigonometric functions

> [!note]
> Indian mathematics is proceeding along very well.
> - making massive innovations that then
> - get moved around the world; exported

# An Improved Numeral System

From the Indian subcontinent:
- We get a very handy system of numerals
	- Developed over centuries
- By the time of Brahmagupta, we got *similar numerals representing 0 to 9, with a place system and decimals*.

Europe was using roman numerals.
- Not very easy to do trigonometry with roman numerals

# Sylvester II (c. 946 - 12 May 1003)

- What is Sylvester II credited with?
	- *bringing* what we call **Arabic numerals** to Europe from Spain
- Why is it referred to as the Arabic numeral system, and not Hindu?
	- It was imported to Europe from the Arabic world.

Sylvester II grew up poor and got shipped to Spain to study.
- Why Spain?
	- Sylvester was just after the height of the [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/06 Global history of science#Islamic Caliphates\|#Islamic Caliphates]].

# Islamic Caliphates


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

$<div class="markdown-embed-title">

# 400

</div>




</div></div>

By 750 CE, everything except the purple bits are under the rule of a Caliphs.
- One of these regions that the Islamic Caliphates took over was Spain
- This gives serious problems as a *conquering* quasi-nation state
	- It is **enormously culturally diverse**
- Conquering does not mean that the Caliphs made every convert to Islam
	- Incentive for those to keep their religion in cultures:
		- non-Muslims pay a higher tax rate
- Strategy that empires have been using for a few thousand years now
	- Pioneered by Mesopotamian empires, Persian, Roman empires did this
	- You take over, you go to a place that has not been conquered yet
	- "We're here to be in charge now"
	- If you say "yes," you get to live
		- Mostly get to stay in charge, keep your religion, pay us taxes, but lives go mostly unaltered
	- If you say "no," then this will involve bronze weapons
- Ideally, you leave their culture intact
	- Massive multicultural
- Caliphs tried to establish **cultural legitimacy**
	- Gather up knowledge and *synthesize* it (particular, in your language)

# The Translation Movement

Around the time of 750 CE,
- A massive project organized and funded by the Caliphs (empire)
	- collect and translate as much knowledge as possible *into Arabic*
		- to make Arabic a *language of learning*
- Conquerers ask people what they know:
	- (about the natural world, philosophy, etc.)
	- $\rightarrow$ translate the knowledge into Arabic so that they can study them 
- Translation Movement sweeps up the works of Aristotle:
	- Works have largely disappeared in Europe after fall of the western Roman empire
	- Translation Movement finds copies and translates it into Arabic
# Baghdad's House of Wisdom

Alongside the Translation Movement,
- Baghdad's House of Wisdom
	- state-sponsored places of learning
- Caliphs created a whole class of scribes, scholars, and translators
	- As a top translator, you could earn a book's weight in gold for having brought it into the Arabic language
		- Probably did not happen often

> [!note]
> - Not only are they *collecting* and *synthesizing* knowledge from recently conquered Caliphate,
> 	- they are also *advancing* the state of knowledge


# ibn Hayyān (721 - 815 BCE)

- Wrote on a huge variety of topics
	- cosmology, medicine, philosophy, alchemy (chemistry)
- What is he credited with?
	- discovering *aqua regia*
		- mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid $\rightarrow$ dissolves gold

# ibn al-Haytham (965 - 1040)

- His most important contribution for our purposes:
	- **Contribution to scientific method**

> “The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and,.. attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.”

- This is the kind of critical attitude that is a cornerstone of modern science
	- Contr. to the way you might have been told how knowledge used to work:
		- "The older a piece of knowledge is, the more reliable it is."
- al-Haytham says:
	- Don't believe it because it is old. Doubt everything you are presented with.
	- Stating the principle of [[100 📒 Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/02 Pure and Applied Science#^2b3796\|organized skepticism]]

# Theories of Optics

- **Intromission**
	- Aristotelian:
		- Somehow, the air is altered by things coming into your eye
		- Intromission is going in
		- The transparent medium of vision is altered by external objects
	- Epicurean:
		-  A thin layer of a thing peels off and hits the eye
			- This is not right, though

- **Extromission**
	- Theory that something comes *out* of your eye
	- Euclidean:
		- a "visual cone" passes out of your eyes and touches stuff
	- Galenic:
		- a "visual fire" comes out of the eye
			- does not have Euclid's geometric aspect

# ibn al-Haytham's synthesis

- al-Haytham takes the best parts of these various ideas, and synthesizes
	- puts them together into the modern idea of how the eyes work
	> [!note] 
	> Stuff goes in, but it does so in a kind of cone of light

# Geometry of Perspective

- Based on al-Haytham's geometric treatment of vision,
	- get rules for constructing perspective drawings
	- used in Renaissance Europe

# Beyond Copernicus

- Those are the things Copernicus gets:
	- Gets mathematics, da Vinci (in Renaissance)
- Copernicus is also the *benefactor*
	- People who take Copernicus, and run with his thing, and produce this thing, are *benefactors* of a couple other major contributions of the rest of the world
		- This is a whole style of thinking that one might call ***Mechanism***

# Mechanism

- Mechanism
	- the philosophy of the scientific revolution
		- its best understanding of how the world works
		- what a good explanation of something looks like
- Mechanism says:
	- the real cause of something (and real proper way to explain it) is what **pushed and pulled it – what jostled it**

**How else could you explain things?**
- Before mechanism, Aristotle (and Aristotelians) was the guy:
	- Thought rocks fall down because the essence of the rock is to want to return to its proper place in the universe
		- of course, the centre of the universe
	- Why does a rock fall in water?
		- Proper place of water is above the rocks, but below the air
	- Goal of fire is to return to its proper place up above the air
		- It is their essence
	- There are *essences*, *purposes*, *goal-based behaviours* — none of this is about the "push and pull forces" that act on separate bodies
		- So, during the *scientific revolution*, people start to think that does not sound right

**Thomas Hobbes**
> “But if you ask what they mean by heaviness, they will define it to be an endeavour to go to the centre of the earth. So that the cause why things sink downward, is an endeavour to be below: which is as much to say that bodies descend, or ascend, because they do…”

- There is a circularity in this explanation:
	- Rocks want to go down because it is their proper place in the universe
	- It is their proper place in the universe because they want to go down
- You do not get much out of that conclusion

So, mechanism comes along:
- an alternative to purposes, goals, essences
- "Just tell me what stuff does," like pushing and pulling for ea

# The Clock Metaphor

During the scientific revolution, the metaphor of nature as a kind of clock becomes very important.
- The universe as an elaborate clockwork
	- You make a clock for a purpose:
		- Everybody believed that God built the universe with some goal in mind
			- The Great plan is still there, somehow
	- Within a clock, you can explain everything it does in terms of its "pushing" and "pulling"
		- The gear moves because that wheel turned, and that wheel turned ...
	- You can explain every single interaction inside a clock in terms of its local pushing and pulling on other parts
		- That gives you a *full, complete* explanation in some sense of what is going on
	- **The clock metaphor is a crucial grounding piece of mechanical philosophy**
- Mechanical philosophy
	- Does huge amounts of intellectual work for clearing out this Aristotelian mess (of goals, essences)
	- People start asking much better questions:
		- b/c they are trying to frame things in mechanisms

## Early Clocks
- There were lots of ways of keeping time in the ancient world:
	- Sun dials
	- Let water drip through a hole
	- Burn a candle of a certain width
- The Doctrine of Signature
	- "Walnuts are good for headaches"
		- They look like a brain
	- You understand the world as thought as it is a set of puzzles sent to us by God in this metaphorical residence between things
		- Not a great way of doing science
-  A good way of science is to try to figure out what push and pulls things
	- People made a lot of scientific progress with the mechanical philosophy

## Chinese Clocks

- Just before and during the scientific revolution, there were some impressive inventions being brought into Europe during the time of the Mongolian empire
	- Masterpieces of mechanical engineering coming into Europe
### Su Song's Water Clock (1020 - 1101 CE)
- Europe is inspired and impressed by how much you can do with mechanisms by Chinese mechanical engineering
- Su Song finished this in 1094
- Mechanical clock
	- Has a model of the sky at the top (*armillary sphere*)
	- All the stars and constellations are printed outside of this thing
	- Rotate in sync with the actual sky
- Final version had a "mechanically-timed and rotating mannequins dressed in miniature Chinese clothes that exited miniature opening doors to announce the time of day"
	- by presenting designated reading plaques, ringing bells and gongs, or beating drums
- Complex piece of mechanical engineering

Among the clever mechanisms in Su Song's clock is the first recorded continuous **chain drive**.
- First recorded continuous chain drive

> [!note] The Clock Metaphor
> These and a variety of other mechanisms were coming through the Mongolian empire to Europe in the period preceding the scientific revolution
> - **Bala suggests that these very impressive inventions were part of the story of what inspired the mechanical view of nature**


# Movable Type

Another thing that really inspires Europeans is **movable type**.
- Scientific revolution is absolutely put on steroids by Gutenberg's development of printed press
- **Gutenberg is by no means the first person to use *movable type***
	- When you have a bunch of little characters you can slot into a matrix, cover with ink, and print
- There is debate and unclarity about what gets moved where, when
	- However, record of Europeans around the time before Gutenberg's specific printing press of people reporting the *existence of movable type from China*
- Why did it not blow up in China the way it did in Europe?
	- Too many characters in Chinese
		- Though, the script gets simplified in time
	- You need 8,000 different buckets of squares — labour-intensive
- Moveable type means that you can print a bunch of different books with the same blocks

> [!note] 
> Moveable type $\rightarrow$ printing press $\rightarrow$ reproducing info vastly easier and more reliable

- The mechanical metaphor through impressive mechanisms and the idea of moveable type was important for China

# Science Wars

To bring all of this back to the original questions...
- These are all examples brought up by Bala about stuff that gets brought up into Europe in very similar ways to the way that the Islamic Caliphates conquering and hoovering up knowledge from everywhere they interact with, translating it into their language of learning, and synthesizing it, and doing other work based on it
- **Bala argues that the scientific revolution is another example of that, but with Europe instead of Islamic Caliphates.**
	- Modern science was made possible by millennia of conversations between various civilizations
	- If you do not see how Europe tells itself the story about how they are just going back to the Ancient Greek roots,
		- that is to cover their tracks to pretend they are not getting this from (mostly) the Islamic world and China
		- They are importing *huge* amounts of knowledge from all around the world
		- They are inheritors of a kind of intensity of racism that we simply cannot replicate in modern day
- To say that you got an idea from foreign lands is immediately suspect
	- Whereas, if you say you are revising Ancient Greek knowledge, that is okay

They tell themselves the story: the story of the **Dark Ages**
- The revival Ancient Greek knowledge is (in some sense) a story told by Renaissance Europeans to themselves
	- to explain a way that all the stuff they are importing from the rest of the world

Material resources that Copernicus drew on to do his work would not have been available in Ancient Greece
- They had not been developed and imported yet
- They were developed in many places across the world
	- and then imported to Europe *before* Copernicus does his work in the (1500s)

This is Bala's argument about the ***dialogical model***.
- Supposed to undercut *both* sides of the debate from post-modern and modernists
	- Both of whom assume that in the science world of the 90s:
		1. Science is fundamentally European, and that is a problem
		2. Science is fundamentally European, and that is okay
- Bala is giving this history lesson to say **it is not fundamentally European**
	- Something unique and impressive did happen in Europe NOT because of some special European character
		- It was a synthetic project from all around the world
			- As has happened before when some region gains power over another part of the world, one of the things they do is gather knowledge and synthesize it, and start building on it

> [!note] 
> If you do not get how the scientific revolution is like the pre-existing examples of people gathering knowledge from places they conquered, **you do not get what the scientific revolution was**
> - It was not a European project — it was a global project, ongoing for millenia

Re: realism and anti-realism prompt

> [!note] 
> With reference to the arguments presented in the reading by Okasha, give an argument for either realism or anti-realism with respect to electrons.

- Realism:
    - Obviously real, call it real, hence “realism”
