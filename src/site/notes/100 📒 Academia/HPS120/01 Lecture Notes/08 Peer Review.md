# The Classic View of Peer Review

> "The fact is that the publication of scientific paper is by no means unconstrained. An article in a reputable journal does not merely represent the opinions of its author; it bears the *imprimatur* [the imprint] of scientific authenticity, as given to it by the editor and the referees he may have consulted. The referee is the lynchpin about which the whole business of Science is pivoted."
>
>Ziman, J. M., Public Knowledge: The Social Dimension of Science (Cambridge University Press, 1966), p. 148

- In ideal science, peer review differentiates science from astrology, alchemy, and other practices that are unscientific
	- Somebody checks your work
	- Prof argues: while the system is necessary in some form, *it is deeply flawed*
# The Modern View of Peer Review

> "The scientific peer review process is one of the weakest links in the process of scientific knowledge production."
> 
> Huisman, J., & Smits, J. (2017). Duration and quality of the peer review process: the author's perspective. Scientometrics, 113(1), 633-650. p. 633

# The Royal Society (of London for Improving Natural Knowledge)

- Founded in 1660
	- Oldest scientific society still in existence
- Starts from an invisible college
	- Group of informal connections between people trying to do science in the 1660s
	- Meetings become institutionalized under a Royal Charter
		- King says "that is good stuff!"
	- i.e., A variety of informal scientific societies come together and get institutionalized under a royal charter
	- Small group, starting with 12 members
		- Growing to only 100 or so over the next century
- Idea was:
	- Get together and share scientific knowledge
	- Would either report the results of experiments, or perform experiments during meetins
	- "Nullius in Verba" (Take nobody's word for it)
		- Don't take somebody's word for it because they wrote it down
	- Francis Bacon says we need to interrogate everything we've got
		- Learn new stuff from experiments
		- Precisely what they do in their meetings
			- Show me the experiment, or tell me how to do the experiment so that I can do it at home

They founded the first ever scientific journal:
# Philosophical Transactions

- Began publication shortly after the founding of the Royal Society
- Formally associated with it shortly (100 years) after
- Considered the oldest scientific journal still publishing
- One of their first problems:
	- Finding enough stuff to publish each month
	1. Weren't that many working scientists
	   - Don't all know each other, no Internet
	   - Had to personally known somebody associated with science
	2. Attitude towards knowledge:
	   - Ideas were personal property
	   - A valuable resource you would not just give away
	   - What if somebody come and takes it from you and steals the credit?
- Fairly slowly, this attitude gets replaced with the more common view now:
	- Publish specifically to *establish* intellectual credit
	- Putting something in a scientific journal prevents something from being stolen
		- vs. inviting it in the old view

# Beginnings of Peer Review

- Henry Oldenburg
	- One of the founding members of the Royal Society
	- First "editor" of the Philosophical Transactions
- Heroic version of this story:
	- His habit of sending manuscripts off to experts for review kicks off the practice of **peer-review** in science
	- Oldenburg understood he did not have the expertise to evaluate everything that was sent
		- Would send it to friends who did have the expertise
	- Note: very different from peer review system now
		- Oldenburg decides who to send it to
	- People go: "Aha, this is precisely in the spirit of Francis Bacon's trust nothing you cannot see with your own eyes"
		- But, they totally did not do peer review from then on

> Baldwin, M. (2015). Credibility, peer review, and Nature, 1945‚Äì1990. Notes and Records: the Royal Society journal of the history of science, 69(3), 337-352.
> 
> ‚ÄúThe Brimble‚ÄìGale era is now most famous for the editors‚Äô unsystematic approach to external refereeing. Although Brimble and Gale did sometimes consult external referees, papers submitted or recommended by scientists whom the pair trusted were often not sent out for further review. Their successor, John Maddox, would also print papers he admired without external refereeing. It was not until 1973 that editor David Davies made external peer review a requirement for publication in Nature.‚Äù (p.337)
{ #d957c3}


- Brimble-Gale did not review everything they saw:
	- e.g., if they liked you, they would put it in the journal

# Watson-Crick Paper on DNA

- [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/08 Peer Review#^d957c3\|Baldwin]] recounts the story of the publication of Watson and Crick's seminal paper on the structure of DNA
	- Two pages long
- Sent this to Nature
	1. Partly because it was published weekly (quick turnaround time)
		- Everybody thought that they were close to the structure of DNA
			- When Watson and Crick thought they had it, they sent it to Nature to beat everyone else
	2. Also had connections with the editors
		- Friends with Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was friends with the editors
		- Submitted paper through him, and Bragg wrote a glowing cover letter for it
	- Paper was published without peer review
		- Got a Nobel Prize for this

# The Real Hero of Peer-Review

The photocopier.
- Two things happened around the same time:
	- Late 1950s and early 60s:
		- Amount of scientific output increased considerably
		- Photocopiers became common, making it easier to send copies of a manuscript to potential peer-reviewers
			- Made people much more willing to do peer-review

# Modern Peer Review

- Trying to get an article published typically means sending it to a scientific journal
- Editors of that journal will look at it
	- Either pass it on to reviewers or not
		- Typically two or three reviewers
- If it gets to reviewers, they can be:
	- Single blinded
		- Reviewers know the author
		- Author does not know the reviewers
	- Double blinded
		- Neither reviewers or authors know each other
	- Open (unblinded)
		- e.g., grant proposals
- Breaking blind
	- Reviewers might recognize writing style of author, or know who is working on a specialized project
	- Authors might know who the reviewers are if reviewers recommend to cite one of their own works or their peers' works
- Etiquette is to not submit to multiple journals at a time
- Desk rejection
	- Editors decided not to even find somebody to do peer review
- Reviewers make comments on the paper, as well as an *overall assessment*
	- "Accept," "revise and resubmit," or "reject"

# Reasons for Rejection

- Topic of the paper does not fit the journal
- Problems with the writing
	- Physicist Murray Gell-Mann had a paper rejected by Physical Review in 1953
		- Editors did not like his term "curious particles," and their "strangeness"
- Implausible interpretations or conclusions
	- One of the problems with peer-review:
		- Which conclusions seem plausible depend on what you already believe
		- [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/01 Baby Scientists\|Bayesian Priors]] determine the plausibility of a hypothesis given some set of evidence
		- <mark style="background: #FEFAD0A6;">Really ground-breaking discoveries are going to have a hard time making it through peer review</mark>
			- All the reviewer has to go on are their expectations and your report about your data
	- Reviewers found Rosalind Yalow's claims to be too strong
		- Later won her a Nobel prize
- Simply not enough room in the journal 
	- Krebs cycle was sent back to Krebs with apologies, because they did not have room to print it right then
	- Hard to judge significance of a result before it has been taken up and used by other scientists
		- **The way something becomes significant is that it becomes a part of further scientific practice, not just because you know it.**
{ #553658}

- Results not interesting enough
	- Polymerase chain reaction
	    - > ‚ÄúBoth Nature and Science rejected one of the first reports by Kary B. Mullis concerning the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which became the most widespread method for analyzing DNA \[MULLIS, 1998, P. 105\]. This was the discovery for which Mullis shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Apparently the editors of Science had little faith in the revolutionary technique that was about to modernize DNA analysis with its practical applications, and believed that the paper would be more appropriate for a secondary journal. As a consequence the article appeared later in Methods in Enzymology.‚Äù Campanario, p. 555
	- Sent it to the top journal
	- Top journal believes its correct, but does not think it is a big deal
		- Suggests sending it to a "lesser" journal
	- Then, Mullis won a Nobel Prize
		- Again, [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/08 Peer Review#^553658\|things acquire significance in science largely by being taken up in scientific practice]]
			- Thing you do not find out until people have the time to start using it in their own research
			- Reviewer/editor has imperfect access to how important something is going to be
- From "Rejecting and resisting Nobel class discoveries: accounts by Nobel Laureates" by Juan Miguel Campanario (2009)
- These were reasons given for rejecting papers that would eventually get published and earn their authors a nobel prize

# The Reading

Tennant, J. P. (2018). The state of the art in peer review. _FEMS Microbiology Letters_, _365_(19). [https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fny204](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fny204)

- Has a PhD, has worked in academic
- Currently works outside of the university system
	- Largely doing advocacy and activism about peer-review itself
	- Worked for a number of Open Science organizations, advocating specifically for changes in peer review
- He is not against peer-review
	- He is against the way it currently is run and looking for solutions

## Objections to the Current State of Peer Review

- Peer review is slow
- Bias against negative results and replication studies
	- From the perspective of the journal editor:
		- What you want is for your journal to be a high-prestige, high-impact journal
		- Want to make a splash with the articles; interesting and important
- Bias against women, people from the global south, non-English speakers, and lower prestige institutions
	- Result of single blinding or failures of double blinding
	- Maybe you submit a paper that does not have perfect English grammar
		- People will unconsciously judge that as not as valid as someone whose grammar is perfect
- Lack of transparency
- No recognition for reviewers
	- Volunteers, doing it out of the kindness of their heart, they will get to review when they get to it
	- Huge amount of effort goes into peer reviewing ‚Äî no recognition

From: Walker, R., & Rocha da Silva, P. (2015). Emerging trends in peer review‚Äîa survey. Frontiers in neuroscience, 9, 169.

### Unreliability

- Had been objected that peer-review is unreliable
- Kravitz et. al. looked at recommendations to accept or reject a paper at the Journal of General Internal Medicine
- ‚ÄúReviewers at JGIM agreed on recommendations to reject vs. accept/revise at levels <u>barely beyond chance</u>, yet editors placed considerable weight on reviewers' recommendations.‚Äù
	- Kind of a coin flip whether they say yes, and they disagree with each other
		- If peer-review was reliable, shouldn't they agree?
	- 

From: Kravitz, R. L., Franks, P., Feldman, M. D., Gerrity, M., Byrne, C., & Tierney, W. M. (2010). Editorial peer reviewers' recommendations at a general medical journal: are they reliable and do editorscare?. PloSone, 5(4), e10072.

## Cultural Inertia

- Tennant suggests that despite these problems being widely recognized, progress to address them has been slow
	- To start a new way of doing things one must demonstrate that it works
		- But to demonstrate that it works, one much have a bunch of people using it
- Starting a new journal has no initial prestige
	- People have to send in their articles
	- Articles have to be good that people want to read the journal
	- You do not have enough time to run an experiment and then send it to some new journal
		- You will want to send it to a prestigious journal
		- And you cannot send it to both journals
- **How do you get the whole pack to move at the same time toward a new system?**
	- There is a inertia here that is very hard to break
	- There are also forces against the system: consensus that the system needs to be improved

## Vested Interest

- You do not get paid for publishing in a journal
- Another factor here is that people who own much of the infrastructure of traditional publishing are private corporations
	- Elsevier runs over 2,500 journals
		- Primarily scientific and medical
	- > ‚ÄúIn 2010, Elsevier‚Äôs scientific publishing arm reported profits of ¬£724m on just over ¬£2bn in revenue. It was a 36% margin ‚Äì higher than Apple, Google, or Amazon posted that year.‚Äù
- If you are an executive, you are not going to say "let's change the system!"

**So, what should we do?**
## Some suggestions

- One broad collection of suggestions is called Open Science
{ #8955e8}

	- Open access (no library card to read journal articles)
	- Being less gate-keeping about who you are going to have conversations with
		- Open dialogue with other knowledge systems
	- Open engagement of societal factors
		- Having people who have a stake in your outcomes be apart of the conversation

### Open Publishing ‚Äì e.g., Pre-Print Archives

Along with the Internet grew pre-print archives:
- Perhaps the most famous is arXiv
	- You can send a "pre-print"
		- You are hoping to get this published one day
	- Meant to be a place to throw a manuscript up for other people to see
	- Different journals have different policies about pre-print archives
- These have been moderated, but not peer-reviewed
	- In the same way that YouTube is moderated
	- Not evaluating it for quality
	- Just making sure that it is sort of a scientific paper, in the right category, not egregiously horrifying
	- It is not an endorsement of the paper
		- vs. journal endorsing the article (because they look at it before publishing)
<br>
- Basic idea:
	- Scientists can communicate with each other outside the traditional publishing model
- Some journals allow, and some restrict posting pre-prints on public archives
- Does not threaten traditional journals, because the prestige of publication does not attach to a pre-print

### Open Commentary ‚Äì e.g., PubPeer

- Alongside pre-print archives, some platforms for public comment on scientific papers have emerged
	- e.g., PubPeer
		- Sort of a community, but also a Chrome extension that adds an option to make or view comments on scientific papers
- One example of commentary:
	- ![pubpeer.png|500](/img/user/Files/03%20HPS120/pubpeer.png)
	- No text, just two sections of an image from the paper highlighted by red boxes
		- Sections are pixel for pixel identical
		- Highly unlikely, unless it has been Photoshopped

- Open comments on pre-prints are also not go/no-go decisions
- A peer-reviewer in traditional publishing must decide whether a paper makes it to the public or not
	- Whereas on pre-print servers, comments can add context, caveats, and suggestions without making an overall determination on the paper

# Tenure, Grants, and Promotion

- Big hurdle for the establishment of open science:
	- Recognition in things like job, grant, tenure, and promotion applications
		- Hesitant to do open science because they want recognition
	- If you can change the way tenure, grants, and promotion is made, then you can change all of this
		- These applications require publications, and pre-prints do not qualify
- There is a reason for this though:
	- Standard academic peer-review remains the most rigorous standard for evaluating research
		- produces quantifiable results
	- Getting something on a pre-print server is not especially hard

# Gatekeeping Science

- None of this should be taken to suggest that peer review can simply be thrown out
- Some mechanism for distinguishing high and low quality science seems necessary
- There does not appear to be an easy answer here

# Key Terms

- Peer review

- Preprint archive
- Open Commentary
