# What constitutes a person as a scientist?
# Recap of Baby Scientists

- Children seem to build theories (based on statistical evidence) to understand the world
- They update those theories based on new evidence
    - taking into account their prior beliefs
    - interface between what they believed before the experiment and the new evidence

Is everyone a scientist then?

# Who is a scientist

Constraining the use of the word “scientist”

- Scientific communities
    - make somebody productive in the sense of discovering new things in the world, being able to create new
    - connected to other people engaged in the same project in the right ways
- There are ways of formalizing participation:
    - university degrees, publishing papers, attending conferences, etc.

But, some people out of that community could still be performing what we call “science.”

- e.g., FoldIt
    - “Citizen science” (people who don’t necessarily have a degree in science)

## Flat Earthers

- They **ARE** scientists.
    - perform experiments
- They **ARE NOT** scientists.
    - Not engaged with the scientific community “in the right way” — they are *hostile* to it
        - Believe there is a vast global conspiracy, including the scientific community, to keep the truth from us
    - The way you have to defend this is to believe that there is enormous coordinated conspiracy to hide the truth from people
        - in some sense, cut yourself off from the scientific community

> [!important] Science requires trust
> - Imagine if you had to start from scratch:
> 	- e.g., you don’t believe that acids and bases neutralize
> 	- Kind of not a scientist anymore — you’re doing your own thing



# Community Norms

How do we determine who belongs in the scientific community?

- Scientists try to come up with truths about the world:
    1. predict models
    2. uses their senses

But, what else?

## Mertonian Norms

- 1940s sociologist of science Robert Merton argued that four basic norms govern the scientific community:
    - Communism
        - Science is shared widely and freely (vs. trade secrets)
        - When you discover something, you *share* it freely.
            - contr. not everything done in an experiment is included and shared in a published article
        - Patents contradict Mertonian norms
            - restricts access to science
        - NOT Marxism
            - You do not have to be a communist to be a scientist
    - Universalism
        - Idea that we don’t evaluate scientific results based on the nationality or other demographic facts about the discoverer
            - A scientific truth from a rival nation is just as true!
    - Disinterestedness
        - Idea that scientists care about the truth, not being correct
            - If someone shows you that your theory is wrong, you’re supposed to be happy that the truth has been revealed
    - Organized Skepticism
        - Not accepting things without evidence (or without considering alternatives)

# Lucier (2011)

- Reading looks at the ***distinction between pure and applied science*** as it was understood in the 1800s

## Pure science

> “…it is not an uncommon thing, especially in American newspapers, to have the applications of science confounded with pure science; and some obscure American who steals the ideas of some great mind of the past, and enriches himself by the application of the same to domestic uses, is often lauded above the great originator of the idea, who might have worked out hundreds of such applications had his mind possessed the necessary element of vulgarity.”

— Henry Rowland, 1883

### The Gilded Age

- Period after American Civil war (before about 1900)
- Overall wealth was increasing rapidly, but it was unequally distributed
- Remembered as a period of intense materialism, but also massive inequality
    - People intensely motivated by money, but not having enough of it
- Massive corporations are flourishing, but many people are having a tough time
- Pursuit of money is the overwhelming obsession of the culture
    - also understood to be crass, low, vulgar

## So, the pure scientist

- performed exclusively for the love of knowledge
- “Purity referred to motivation—truth before gain. ‘Pure science’ was therefore defined by its non pecuniary nature.” (p. 531)
    - Not that pure science was always useless, but it needed to be pursued for its own sake, rather than any material or financial benefit
- e.g., probably had to start a fire to keep a room warm $\rightarrow$ now, there’s electric heating
    - Companies make a lot of money by making this technology
        - vs. a research job

> [!important] Rowland is largely arguing for salaried research positions that aren’t tied to producing useful products
> - Excludes people doing research for product development
> 	- There’s research done in companies for product development
> - also excludes most university jobs which involve teaching
> 
> Rowland wants guaranteed salaries for just doing pure scientific research

## Applied Scientist

Applied science contrasts (but is not the opposite of) pure science

- You don’t have applied science without pure science
    - There’s a sequence:
        1. Somebody does the pure science
        2. That model exists for somebody else to use — to do something
            1. e.g., Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone (helps people, but also makes a lot of money!)

> “Research is none the less genuine, investigation none the less worthy, because the truth it discovers is utilizable for the benefit of mankind. Granting, even, that the discovery of truth for its own sake is a nobler pursuit [than] that [of] the man who discovers nothing himself, but only applies to useful purposes the principles which others have discovered. . . . But when the investigator becomes himself the utilizer; when the same mind that made the discovery contrives also the machine by which it is applied to useful purposes, —the combined achievement must be ranked as superior to either of its separate results.” (Editors of Science, which Bell had recently purchased, quoted on p. 533)
> 
- Argument for impure science — a person who can use those principles for the good of humankind, better than somebody who just does the pure stuff

# Can we separate “pure” and “applied?”

- Lucier suggests the presumed model of things being discovered by “pure” scientists and then pillaged for dollars by “applied” scientists might be too simple.
    - Are there cases where applied science made new discoveries?
        - Space discovery (NASA, CSA)

# Pure Scientists and Mertonian Norms

> [!note] The “pure” scientist matches with Mertonian norms.
> - No interest in controlling the knowledge they produce
> 	- Communism
> - Aren’t looking for any particular result
> 	- Disinterestedness

But is this how people actually like that?

- Arguably not
    - If you’ve invested your whole career in a theory, you ****want**** it to be true. You’re invested.

Is science doomed?

- If we’re not these pure beings who have love for knowledge, is science doomed?
    - Hopefully not.
- If your picture of science is people being angels, that’s worrying
    - Philosophy science goals:
        1. We want an accurate description of science — true to the reality.
        2. Justified — science is a thing that can produce deep truths about the universe, profoundly useful models to do stuff
- The more rigorous you describe scientific reasoning, the more unrealistic it becomes
    - If you describe a scientist as right (vs. wrong), then there must not be that many scientists
        - doesn’t happen often

# Transformative Criticism

- Merton’s view is asking A LOT
- Helen Longino provides a more achievable way of defining science
    - 1990 book “Science as Social Knowledge”
- Suggests that real people are biased, flawed, and self-interested a lot of the time
    - We have values (things we care about) that influence our view of things
- If you get a community with the right features, it’s okay that the individuals in the community might be biased, flawed
    - crucial thing that community needs to support is transformative criticism
    - If you have people trying their best to get to the truth, then we can make progress towards objective truth
        - objective means not subjective to the values of the individual that it might compromise something is true
        - if the community is structured just right, objectivity emerges as a property of the whole
            - you don’t need individuals to be objective; objectivity is a GROUP effort

> “A method of inquiry is objective to the degree that it permits *transformative* criticism. […] Scientific communities are objective to the degree that they satisfy four criteria necessary for achieving the transformative dimension of critical discourse;”
> 
1. There must be recognized avenues for the criticism of evidence, methods, and of assumptions and reasoning
	- You got to have some recognized, formalized way of critiquing every scientific paradigm, method, etc.
	- hasn’t been true in all cases; e.g., scientist in the USSR: you could be sent to the Gulag for saying the wrong thing! Not an open avenue for criticism
2. There must exist shared standards that critics can invoke
3. The community as a whole must be responsive to such criticism
	- So, you’ve got a shared set of standards to make a good point, and people have to be listening
4. Intellectual authority must be shared equally among qualified practitioners
	- If you’ve shown yourself to be an apt member of the community, they have to be listening to you

## Failure of Shared Standards

- Failure for transformative criticism in conspiracy theories like flat earth
- Ancient Greek polymath Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth, by measuring the angle of sunlight in two different places at the same time
    - Why don’t flat earthers do that?
- This argument only works if you agree on the shape of the map
    - Flat earthers actually debate amongst each other the real organizations of the continents, etc.
        - Basic failure to agree on a background of beliefs that we all use to evaluate a given argument
- Never just look at a piece of evidence for a theory by itself
    - Evaluate it against a set of background beliefs
    - If you shatter that background belief by saying “everyone who has worked at NASA is apart of a global conspiracy”, you don’t get to have transformative criticism

### Failure of Responsiveness

- Dan Olson did an experiment to show that the earth is curved
    - When his methods seemed to hold up to scrutiny, he is simply told to pray about it
        - That is NOT responsiveness to counter-evidence

## Paradigms help make transformative criticism possible

- paradigms
    - set of shared assumptions, standards of evidence, experimental methods, etc., that help communities critique each others ideas in *meaningful* ways
        - also applies to shared standards of evaluation for ideas
    - shared set of assumptions so people can talk to each other!
- If the community is structured well, the overall view shifts
    - Any individual cannot be counted on to be objective
    - We want the community to be structured, so the individual doesn’t need to be
- Community can converge on truth
    - e.g., look at any paradigm shift
        - Newtonian physics $\rightarrow$ relative physics
            - light curves if you’re moving fast
- Paradigm shifts can change shared standards

# Tutorial

Navigate what we mean by pure and applied science.

$$
\text{Pure}  \neq \text{Applied}
$$

- pure science
    - science for the love of knowledge and truth
- applied science
    - technology

## Scientific community

Scientific communities have:

- standards and norms
- specialized training
- trust

Pseudoscience groups do NOT have this.

## Mertonian Norms

1. **Communism**
    1. Science should be shared freely.
2. **Organized Skepticism**
3. **Universalism**
    1. related to (1). Scientific knowledge is shared by everyone
4. **Disinterestedness**
    1. Scientists care about the truth, and NOT being right all the time
    2. Problematic: people are often self-interested and biased! According to Merton, if you want material compensation for your work, then you are not a scientist…

Which is why Longino proposed another set of norms.

## What is Lucier suggesting?

- Gilded Age: The moment where the distinction between pure and applied science came out.

Manhattan Project

- conjunction between the pure and applied
- Could the nuclear weapon been possible without that pure scientific knowledge (nuclear fission, etc.)?

## Transformative Criticism

Longino proposed:

- Shared standards
- Avenues for criticism should be enforced. Society should foster criticism.
    - vs. scientists in the USSR
- Responsiveness
- Shared intellectual authority
