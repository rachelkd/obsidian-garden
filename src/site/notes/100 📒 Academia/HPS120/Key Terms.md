# Week 2 - Baby Scientists
See [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/01 Baby Scientists\|Baby scientists]].

### Scientific theories
- **What**
	- Scientific theories are abstract, structured, and coherent frameworks that make predictions about different situations in the world.
	- Abstract means that the sensory representations of the theory do not represent the actual object itself. Although data is concrete (e.g., readings on a thermometer), the theories themselves are abstract. For example, force itself cannot be captured as an object, but we can infer that there is a (unobservable) pull on all objects. Abstraction is fundamental because scientific theories are meant to be general. Generalizations allow scientific theories to make *good predictions* even if under different circumstances.
	- Structure in this definition refers to the innate structure; there must be some sort of knowledge that one is born with to arrive at a theory. Immanuel Kant argued that one has to start with ideas of space and time to make sense of one‚Äôs senses, otherwise one could not know where to begin. For example, babies seem to start an understanding of distance; they know what they can reach and what they cannot reach.
	- Coherence means that the data and observations have to align with the theory.
- **Where**
	- This term was introduced in the ‚ÄúBaby Scientists‚Äù lecture, but has shown up in topics in ‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù and ‚ÄúRealism and Anti-Realism.‚Äù In Baby Scientists, Gopnik argues that children test hypotheses and make theories just like scientists. 
- **Why**
	- This argument is significant because it questions the ways people often think of science: who is a scientist? If a baby can test hypotheses, does that make them a scientist? Is science simply making good predictions, like children predicting if a person likes the colour green?
	- The term ties into the discussion about realism and anti-realism.
		- Since scientific theories are abstract, anti-realists argue that theories can only make good predictions, but cannot be true as it cannot be observed.
		- The search for absolute truth is not necessary, and arguably not possible according to the anti-realists and empiricists.
### Causation
- **What**
	- Causation in science is the idea that one ‚Äúcause‚Äù or variable leads to an effect or change in another variable.
	- Causation in science is a controversial topic: empiricists believe that all knowledge is grounded in sense experience. However, causation cannot be translated into a sense experience.
		- For example, if a cue ball hits other pool balls, it cannot be claimed that the cue ball caused the other balls to move, because there is no explicable difference between the cue ball causing the pool balls to move and the cue ball stopping and the other balls spontaneously moving. 
	- Causation is an invisible metaphysical entity with no correlate in the sense experience.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about ‚ÄúBaby Scientists,‚Äù where we discussed Gopnik‚Äôs argument that children are like baby scientists. Children learn and update inferences by performing science-like experiments to determine causation.
- **Why**
	- Gopnik's thesis is run backwards to think about science: is there an explicit way to describe that one thing causes another thing? Are scientific conclusions strictly based on sense experience? If they are like the empiricists say so, then it cannot be certain that gravity makes objects on Earth fall, as force is not translated into sense experience. This suggests that the way to go about science may not be to find objective truth in the natural world.
### Paradigms
- **What**
	- Paradigms are a set of beliefs about what is relevant, interesting, and important, and they provide expectations on how to study something. They help decide what is worth studying. For example, it would not be worth studying whether a person wearing a blue sweater would affect their response to heart medication ‚Äî in the current medical paradigm, the prior probability (chances of the colour blue affecting a person‚Äôs response to medication before studying it) would be incredibly low. In a way, paradigms are like binoculars; they enormously allow you to narrow a field of vision. Certain things are likely to be important, and the rest is ignored, allowing one to make developments in science easier.
- **Where**
	- This term first appeared in the ‚ÄúBaby Scientists‚Äù lecture. Gopnik argued that children update their beliefs using Bayesian statistical models. To do this, babies need a prior probability that is rooted in paradigms. Paradigms in this context are societal or innate.
- **Why**
	- These innate paradigms tie into Immanuel Kant's argument that one has to start off with some ideas of space and time in order to make sense of one's senses. There must be some paradigmatic *structure* that the baby follows that help them make predictions (prior probability).

# Week 3 - Pure and applied science
See [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/02 Pure and Applied Science\|Pure and applied science]].

### Pure and applied science
- **What**
	- Pure and applied science are the two types science that scientists engage in. Pure science is defined as science for the love of knowledge and truth. This is in contrast to ‚Äî but not opposite to ‚Äî applied science. This distinction occurred during the Gilded Age when people became more obsessed with the pursuit of wealth despite massive inequality. Pure science was done for the sake of science, rather than for any material benefit. Johns Hopkins professor Henry Rowland argued for pure science: he wanted guaranteed salaries for research that was not tied to producing useful products. He condemned the applied scientists who "steal the ideas" of "great minds" for money, positioning pure scientists as greater than applied scientists. Applied science in its simplest form is defined as technology, which generates profit. 
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the "Pure and applied science" lecture.
- **Why**
	- Pure science generates the models that is used in applied science; applied science cannot exist without the pure. Both pure and applied need to co-exist together to the benefit of society. Rowland's argument that the models discovered by pure scientists is pillaged for wealth by the applied scientists removes a lot of complexity, especially in the modern world. Applied science, though capitalistic, can not only help people, but make its own scientific discoveries (space discovery corporations).

### Mertonian Norms
- **What**
	- The Mertonian Norms are a set of ideals produced by sociologist Robert Merton in the 1940s. The ideals describe how scientists should behave. The four norms are: communism, universalism, disinterestedness, and organized skepticism. Communism means that scientific discoveries should be shared freely and widely. Universalism means that a scientific claim should not be evaluated based on the scientist‚Äôs identity. Disinterestedness means that a scientist should not care about anything but the truth ‚Äî they should not care about being correct, rather about the truth. Organized skepticism is the refusal to accept any claim or theory without proper evidence.
- **Where**
	- This appeared in the "pure and applied science" lecture.
- **Why**
	- The Mertonian Norms align nicely with the ideal "pure" scientist (see [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/Key Terms#Pure and applied science\|pure and applied science]]). Both agree that science should be shared freely; thus, science is non-pecuniary. Both are not looking for any particular result, except the truth (disinterestedness in research).
	- However, Mertonian Norms describe an image that is too ideal to exist in the real world. It overlooks the fact that individuals are often biased, hate being wrong, and love having money. The latter was especially true during the Gilded Age, when Rowland clarifies the distinction between pure and impure science. Helen Longino proposes "transformative criticism," which paints a more realistic picture of science in the scientific community.
### Transformative criticism
- **What**
	- Transformative criticism defines a more achievable way of defining science versus Rowland and Merton‚Äôs standards about disinterestedness and communism.
- **Where**
	- This appears in the lecture about ‚Äúpure and applied science.‚Äù Helen Longino suggests that humans are biased, self-interested, and flawed. However, that is okay if there is a structured scientific community: objectivity is a group effort rather than individual. Longino states that there must be (1) recognized, formalized ways of critiquing every scientific paradigm, method, etc., (2) a shared set of standards that critics can invoke, (3) the community must be responsive to such standards, so the community must be listening if an individual makes a good point adhering to the shared set of standards, and (4) intellectual authority must be shared equally among qualified practitioners (i.e., if an individual has shown themself to be an apt member of the community, people need to be listening to them).
- **Why**
	- Longino‚Äôs definition of science is important because it can help discern what groups that claim as a part of science, is in fact, not science. For example, ‚ÄúFlat Earthers‚Äù are conspiracy theorists that believe the Earth is flat. In order to believe that, they need to ignore all forms of criticism and scientific evidence that the Earth is round. They fail to be responsive to scientific standards and fail to share intellectual authority. As such, it can be said that Flat Earthers are not scientists by transformative criticism.
# Week 4 - Anomalies
See [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/03 Anomalies\|Anomalies]].
### Anomaly
- **What**
	- An anomaly is a piece of data or information that does not align with a set of expectations or paradigms. An anomaly exists relative to some scientific framework. This is similar to an ‚Äúoutlier,‚Äù which is a data point ‚Äî often in raw data ‚Äî that does not fit the trend line; however, unlike outliers which can typically be removed in a data set, anomalies are reproducible and often cause scientists to spend some time figuring out the anomaly.
- **Where**
	- This term came up in the discussion about anomalies.
- **Why**
	- As science self-promises itself to change the deep structure of its theories over time, anomalies play an important role in doing so. Anomalies actively challenge scientific paradigms and expectations: it is an achievement to be an anomaly. For example, the Flatness Problem discusses whether the universe is doomed to crunch (because of more gravitational than kinetic energy) or infinitely expand (because of more kinetic than gravitational energy). Scientists found that the ratio of gravitational to kinetic energy was close to 1, which was an uncanny optimistic observation. The ratio could not be explained until the inflationary period theory was proposed. 
### Retrocognition
- **What**
	- Retrocognition describes the case where an anomaly was not recognized as important until after a reasonable explanation was developed for it.
	- It has three rough stages: 1) a fact of nature is observed in the context of an existing explanatory framework, 2) the fact does not have a logical explanation in the existing framework, and 3) a new theory or model is advanced in which the observed fact now has a compelling and reasoned explanation. Simultaneously, the fact is *retroactively* recognized as an anomaly in the content of the old theory or model.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the "anomalies" lecture. Lightman and Gingerich discussed this phenomenon in multiple scientific advancements.
	- For example, continental drift is a case of retrocognition. Before scientists discovered that the continents were once together, some people thought that it was strange that the edges of continents looked like they could connect to each other. However, other people did not care: there was no framework that offered a possible explanation. According to the *paradigms* set in that time, it was not possible for huge rocks to move. It was not until the theory of plate tectonics that people retroactively thought that the observation was important.
- **Why**
	- Retrocognition is the force that drives science to be ever-evolving. Without retrocognition, science would be a finite area of study.

### Planck‚Äôs Principle

- **What**
	- Planck‚Äôs Principle is a kind of demographic framing of scientific conservatism. It is named after physicist Max Planck who argued that a new scientific truth does not triumph by converting its opponents, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. Scientific conservatism tends to be more concentrated in older people, and less concentrated in the young.
- **When**
	- This term appeared in the lecture about anomalies.
- **Why**
	- The principle relates to [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/Key Terms#Retrocognition todo\|retrocognition]]: the phenomenon where an anomaly is not recognized as important until there becomes a reasonable explanation for it. Retrocognition requires a paradigm shift or new theory. If older scientists ‚Äî especially star scientists who take up time, attention, and resources ‚Äî are slower to get on board with new theories and models, then science arguably is not about finding objective truth anymore. Rather, science ‚Äî a field that promises to change its deep structure of theories over time ‚Äî is stalled by social constructs of who deserves the attention and funding.

> A new scientific truth does not triumph by converting its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

# Week 5 - Realism and anti-realism
See [[100 üìí Academia/HPS120/01 Lecture Notes/04 Realism and anti-realism\|Realism and anti-realism]].

### Realism
- **What**
	- Realism is a position apart of the debate about scientific truth: it takes the perspective that scientific theories are, at the very least, approximately true. This contrasts with anti-realism ‚Äì the other stance ‚Äì¬†that is skeptical about unobservable entities in scientific theories. Anti-realists argue that scientific theories cannot be true as they are unobservable. However, if the theory can make good predictions, then it is empirically adequate (i.e., good enough). Both sides agree that if a scientific concept is observable (we can see plants), then we can claim truth (plants exist). The distinction between the two positions is on the unobservable.
- **Where**
	- This term appeared in the "Realism and anti-realism" lecture. 
- **Why**
	- This debate questions the goals of science. Is it enough to just be able to make good predictions, or should science expose truths about the natural world? In addition to the goals of science, the term "unobservable" that is essential to the anti-realist argument is ambiguous: electrons can be used in experiments (e.g., Millikan oil drop experiment), and we can determine their charge. This hints at their existence, but according to the anti-realists, there is no visual sense experience directly related to electrons. Perhaps, a solution to go about this debate is to be a realist or anti-realist case-by-case.
### No Miracles Argument

- **Where**
	- No Miracles was discussed in the lecture on realism and anti-realism. This argument was put forward by Hilary Putnam, in favour of realism.
- **What**
	- The No Miracles Argument says that if scientific theories were as successful as they are, and were not at least approximately true, then it would be a miracle. There are no such things as miracles, therefore, the theories must be at least approximately true. There is some debate about the term ‚Äúapproximately true.‚Äù It is not entirely clear what is meant by ‚Äúapproximately true;‚Äù however, it is important to include some notion of approximate truth in this argument, because lots of strictly speaking false theories make good predictions under many circumstances.
	- Anti-realists respond to the No Miracles argument by pointing out that there have been cases of false theories making good predictions, like the wave theory of light, which required the aether to exist. It makes good predictions, but its basic entity turns out to not exist.
- **Why**
	- This argument is an inference to the best explanation. It is not meant to be an absolute proof of its conclusion, but rather simply evidence for the realist side of the realism vs. anti-realism debate. The status of this argument depends on how common it is for a theory to be successful, but for its most basic entities to not exist. It may be that such cases are anomalies, rather than regular occurrences.

### Underdetermination

- **What**
	- Underdetermination is a relationship between data and a scientific theory, where multiple theories could equally well account for the same data.

- **Where**
	- This was discussed in the class on realism and anti-realism in science.
	- It was used as an argument by anti-realists to defend the idea that we should not believe unobservable entities in scientific theories are real. This phenomenon is a reason for believing the anti-realist position because the position of anti-realism is that science is not giving us an absolute truth, so using an argument that can dilute current theories then shows that our current understanding is not absolutely truthful. If observation cannot decide between two different theories, then the data cannot tell us that either is making correct statements about unobservable entities.

- **Why**
	- This is part of the debate about what exactly the goals of science are: is science about making useful theories and accurate predictions, or does it give us access to the basic machinery of the universe?
