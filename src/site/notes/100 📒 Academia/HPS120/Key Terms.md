# Week 2 - Baby Scientists

### Scientific theories
Scientific theories are abstract, structured, and coherent frameworks that make predictions about different situations in the world. Abstract means that the sensory representations of the theory do not represent the actual object itself. Although data is concrete (e.g., readings on a thermometer), the theories themselves are abstract. For example, force itself cannot be captured as an object. Scientific theories are general, so they are abstract as well. Structure in this definition refers to the innate structure; there must be some sort of knowledge that one is born with to arrive at a theory. Immanuel Kant argued that one has to start with ideas and time — among other things — to make sense of one’s senses. Another example is that babies seem to start an understanding of distance; they know what they can reach and what they cannot reach. Coherence means that the data and observations have to align with the theory.

This term was introduced in the “Baby Scientists” lecture, but has shown up in topics in “Anomalies” and “Realism and Anti-Realism.” Gopnik argues that children make hypotheses and theories just like scientists. This argument is significant because it questions the ways people often think of science: who is a scientist? If a baby can test hypotheses, does that make them a scientist? Additionally, scientific theories tie into the discussion about realism and anti-realism — specifically, abstraction. Since scientific theories are abstract, anti-realists argue that theories can only make good predictions, but cannot be true as it cannot be observed. Coherence in scientific theories also tie into anomalies. Scientific theories update due to anomalies which happen when the observations and data do not align with the expectations.
### Causation
Causation in science is the idea that one “cause” or variable leads to an effect or change in another variable. Causation in science is a controversial topic: empiricists believe that all knowledge grounded in sense experience. However, causation cannot be translated into a sense experience. For example, if a cue ball hits other pool balls, it cannot be claimed that the cue ball caused the other balls to move, because there is no explicable difference between the cue ball causing the pool balls to move and the cue ball stopping and the other balls spontaneously moving. Causation is an invisible metaphysical entity with no correlate in the sense experience. This term appeared in the lecture about “Baby Scientists,” where we discussed Gopnik’s argument that children are like baby scientists. Children learn and update inferences by performing science-like experiments to determine causation. The theory was run backwards to think about science: is there an explicit way to describe that one thing causes another thing? Causation also ties into the “Realism and Anti-Realism” lecture. Anti-realists argued that scientific theories can make predictions, but not be true because we cannot observe this abstract idea. In the same way, strict empiricists do not conclude causation, because it cannot be explained what causation looks like in the sense experience.
### Paradigms
Paradigms are a set of beliefs about what is relevant, interesting, important, and expectations on how to study something. They help decide what is worth studying. For example, it would not be worth studying whether a person wearing a blue sweater would affect their response to heart medication — in the current medical paradigm, the prior probability (chances of the colour blue affecting a person’s response to medication before studying it) would be incredibly low. In a way, paradigms are like binoculars; they enormously allow you to narrow a field of vision. Certain things are likely to be important, and the rest is ignored, allowing one to make developments in science easier. This term first appeared in the “Baby Scientists” lecture. Gopnik argued that children update their beliefs using Bayesian statistical models. To do this, babies need a prior probability that is rooted in paradigms. Paradigms in this context are societal or innate. Paradigms also appear in the “Anomalies” discussion. Our scientific paradigms shift when we are presented with data or observations that do not align with current paradigms. When an explanation arrives for a strange piece of data, the paradigms shift. Paradigms also help rule out pseudoscience: people who believe the Earth is flat have to reject current scientific paradigms that the Earth is in fact round. There is no expectation on how to study this conspiracy theory because there is no evidence to support it.
    

# Week 3 - Pure and Applied Science

[Pure and Applied Science](https://www.notion.so/Pure-and-Applied-Science-1ed38fd309594a059a28d1f6b3140ed8?pvs=21)

### Pure science
Pure science is defined as science for the love of knowledge and truth. This is in contrast to — but not opposite to — applied science. The distinction between pure and applied science occurred during the Gilded Age when people started to become more obsessed with money despite massive inequality. It was argued that pure science had to be done for its own sake, rather than for any material benefit. This term appeared in the “Pure and Applied Science” lecture. The “pure scientist” connects with the Mertonian norms; a pure scientist is disinterested, meaning they are only interested in finding the truth and not being correct, and have no interest in profiting or restricting the knowledge they produce (communism in Mertonian norms). However, it is unlikely that scientists fall into Rowland and Merton’s respective ideas of a “pure scientist.” People are self-interested and want money; Longino presents a more realistic definition of a scientist in “transformative criticism.”
### Applied science
Applied science in its most simplest form is defined as technology. Applied science contrasts — but is not the opposite of — pure science. Technology often makes profit, which violates Rowland’s understanding of pure science. This term appeared in the lecture about pure and applied science. This term is important because applied science cannot exist without the pre-existing models and discoveries from pure science. Contrary to physicist Henry Rowland’s view of applied science, the editors of Science argue that “impure” science is no less genuine and beneficial to society: a person who can use science to create something for the good of humankind is better than just the pure science.
### Mertonian Norms
The Mertonian Norms are a set of ideals produced by sociologist Robert Merton in the 1940s. The ideals describe how scientists should behave. The four norms are: communism, universalism, disinterestedness, and organized skepticism. Communism means that scientific discoveries should be shared freely and widely. Universalism means that a scientific claim should not be evaluated based on the scientist’s identity. Disinterestedness means that a scientist should not care about anything but the truth — they should not care about being correct, rather about the truth. Organized skepticism is the refusal to accept any claim or theory without proper evidence.
- Tutorial brainstorm
	The Mertonian Norms were discussed during the lecture on “Pure and Applied Science.” These set of ideals reflected the idea of a “scientist” during the Gilded Age — a period where the obsession with money was growing, but with massive inequality. The Mertonian Norms is significant because they describe an image of science that may be too ideal to exist in the real world. It overlooks the fact that individuals are often biased, hate being wrong, and love having money. Longino’s “transformative criticism” might paint a more realistic picture of science and a scientific community.
### Transformative criticism
Transformative criticism defines a more achievable way of defining science versus Rowland and Merton’s standards related to disinterestedness and communism. This appears in the lecture about “pure and applied science.” Helen Longino suggests that humans are biased, self-interested, and flawed. However, that is okay if there is a structured scientific community: objectivity is a group effort rather than individual. Longino states that there must be (1) recognized, formalized ways of critiquing every scientific paradigm, method, etc., (2) a shared set of standards that critics can invoke, (3) the community must be responsive to such standards, so the community must be listening if an individual makes a good point adhering to the shared set of standards, and (4) intellectual authority must be shared equally among qualified practitioners (i.e., if an individual has shown themself to be an apt member of the community, people need to be listening to them). Longino’s definition of science is important because it can help discern what groups that claim as a part of science, is in fact, not science. For example, “Flat Earthers” are conspiracy theorists that believe the Earth is flat. In order to believe that, they need to ignore all forms of criticism and scientific evidence that the Earth is round. They fail to be responsive to scientific standards and fail to share intellectual authority. As such, it can be said that Flat Earthers are not scientists by transformative criticism.

# Week 4 - Anomalies

[Anomalies](https://www.notion.so/Anomalies-77760f9858e447e892e9312916225c10?pvs=21)
### Anomaly
An anomaly is a piece of data or information that does not align with a set of expectations or paradigms. In other words, an anomaly exists relative to some scientific framework. This is similar to an “outlier,” which is a data point — often in raw data — that does not fit the trend line; however, unlike outliers which can typically be removed in a data set, anomalies are reproducible and often cause scientists to spend some time figuring out the anomaly. This term came up in the discussion about anomalies. As science self-promises itself to change the deep structure of its theories over time, anomalies play an important role in doing so. Anomalies actively challenge scientific paradigms and expectations: it is an achievement to be an anomaly. For example, the Flatness Problem discusses whether the universe is doomed to crunch (because of more gravitational than kinetic energy) or infinitely expand (because of more kinetic than gravitational energy). Scientists found that the ratio of gravitational to kinetic energy was close to 1, which was an uncanny optimistic observation. The ratio could not be explained until the inflationary period theory was proposed.
**Tutorial brainstorm**
	An anomaly is the collected information that does not fit into a current paradigm. It is not to be confused with an outlier, which is simply a data point that falls outside of a trend within an experiment. An anomaly is reproducible and generally precede scientific revelations that work to change old paradigms. As such, anomalies are important as they provide valuable information on which new scientific theories can be built.    

### Retrocognition

Retrocognition describes the case where an anomaly was not recognized as important until after a reasonable explanation was developed for it.

Retrocognition has three rough stages:

1. A fact of nature is observed in the context of an existing explanatory framework.
2. The fact does not have a logical explanation in the existing framework, but is nevertheless unquestioned or ignored, or accepted as a given property of the world, or simply postulated to be true.
3. A new theory or model is advanced in which the observed fact now has a compelling and reasoned explanation. At the same time, the fact is retroactively recognized as an anomaly in the context of the old theory or model.

This term appeared in the discussion about anomalies. Retrocognition appears in the “Flatness Problem,” and Ptolemy’s solar system. It raises question to what topics and anomalies in science are worth exploring, confirmation bias (where people pay more attention to topics that align with their paradigms and beliefs), and connects to Planck’s Principle.

### Planck’s Principle

**********What**********

Planck’s Principle is a kind of demographic framing of scientific conservatism. It is named after physicist Max Planck who argued that a new scientific truth does not triumph by converting its opponents, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. Scientific conservatism tends to be more concentrated in older people, and less concentrated in the young.

********When********

This term appeared in the lecture about anomalies.

******Why*****

The principle relates to retrocognition, the phenomenon where an anomaly is not recognized as important until there becomes a reasonable explanation for it. Retrocognition requires a paradigm shift or new theory. If older scientists — especially star scientists who take up time, attention, and resources — are slower to get on board with new theories and models, then science arguably is not about finding objective truth anymore. Rather, science — a field that promises to change its deep structure of theories over time — is stalled by social constructs of who deserves the attention and funding.

> A new scientific truth does not triumph by converting its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

# Week 5 - Realism and anti-realism

[Realism and anti-realism](https://www.notion.so/Realism-and-anti-realism-70a6dcf916bc4d36aa11309914a191cc?pvs=21)

### Realism

Realism is the idea that scientific theories are true or approximately true. This contrasts with anti-realism, that is agnostic about the reality of unobservable entities in scientific theories. Realists rely on the No Miracles Argument, which says that scientific theories making as many true predictions as they do would be a miracle if they weren't at least approximately true.

- Scientists are not questioning realism. Realism is questioned by the philosophers of science.
- Antirealists
    - Significance of question? whether scientific theory is true or not

### No Miracles Argument

**********Where**********

No Miracles was discussed in the lecture on realism and anti-realism. This argument was put forward by Hilary Putnam, in favour of realism.

********What********

The No Miracles Argument says that if scientific theories were as successful as they are, and were not at least approximately true, then it would be a miracle. There are no such things as miracles, therefore, the theories must be at least approximately true. There is some debate about the term “approximately true.” It is not entirely clear what is meant by “approximately true;” however, it is important to include some notion of approximate truth in this argument, because lots of strictly speaking false theories make good predictions under many circumstances.

Anti-realists respond to the No Miracles argument by pointing out that there have been cases of false theories making good predictions, like the wave theory of light, which required the aether to exist. It makes good predictions, but its basic entity turns out to not exist.

******Why******

This argument is an inference to the best explanation. It is not meant to be an absolute proof of its conclusion, but rather simply evidence for the realist side of the realism vs. anti-realism debate. The status of this argument depends on how common it is for a theory to be successful, but for its most basic entities to not exist. It may be that such cases are anomalies, rather than regular occurrences.

### Underdetermination

******What******

Underdetermination is a relationship between data and a scientific theory, where multiple theories could equally well account for the same data.

********Where********

This was discussed in the class on realism and anti-realism in science. It was used as an argument by anti-realists to defend the idea that we should not believe unobservable entities in scientific theories are real. This phenomenon is a reason for believing the anti-realist position because the position of anti-realism is that science is not giving us an absolute truth, so using an argument that can dilute current theories then shows that our current understanding is not absolutely truthful. If observation cannot decide between two different theories, then the data cannot tell us that either is making correct statements about unobservable entities.

******Why******

This is part of the debate about what exactly the goals of science are: is science about making useful theories and accurate predictions, or does it give us access to the basic machinery of the universe?
