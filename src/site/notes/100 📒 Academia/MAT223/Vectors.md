# Vectors and Scalars
- What is a scalar number?
	- models a relationship between quantities
- What is a vector?
	- models a relationship between points
	- may be thought of as a *displacement* with a *direction* and *magnitude*
- Example of a vector:
	- Given points $P = (1, 1)$ and $Q = (3, 2)$, we specify the displacement from $P$ to $Q$ as a vector $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ whose magnitude $\sqrt{5}$ (as given by the Pythagorean theorem) and whose direction is specified by a directed line segment from $P$ to $Q$

# Vector Notation
- How to represent a vector for two points $P$ and $Q$
	- $\overrightarrow{PQ}$
- How to represent the magnitude of the vector $\vec{a}$
	- $\mid\mid \vec{a} \mid\mid$
- What is the **magnitude** of $\vec{a}$?
	- *norm* or *length* of $\vec{a}$
- A vector models a *displacement* and has no true sense of “origin”:
	- Consider the following: for the points $A = (1,1)$, $B = (3,2)$, $X = (1,0)$, and $Y = (3,1)$, define the vectors $\vec{a} = \overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\vec{x} = \overrightarrow{XY}$
	  ![vector_has_no_origin.png|400](/img/user/Files/MAT223/vector_has_no_origin.png)
	- Are these the same or different vectors?
		- $\vec{a} = \vec{x}$ despite the fact that $A \neq X$
		- have same magnitude and direction
		- Though, line segments are different because they are at different locations in space

> [!note] Takeaway
> A vector is not the same as a line segment, and a vector by itself has no “origin”.


# Vectors and Points
- A **point** in Euclidean space specifies…
	- an absolute position
- A **vector** specifies
	- a displacement
	- i.e., magnitude and direction
- Given a point $P$, what is the vector associated?
	- $\overrightarrow{OP}$, where $O$ is the origin
- What point is the vector $\vec{v}$ associated with?
	- point $V$ such that $\overrightarrow{OV} = \vec{v}$
- How do we treat vectors and points?
	- *interchangeably*
