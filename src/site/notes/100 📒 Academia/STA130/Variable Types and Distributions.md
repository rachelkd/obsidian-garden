# Variable types

- This course mainly focuses on two types of variables:
	1. **Quantitative** (numerical) values
	2. **Categorical** variables
	- Other types of data (e.g., text data, images, â€¦) are not the focus of this course
- Types of numeric (quantitative) variables:
	- **continuous**
		- *measured* data
		- can have infinite values within a possible range
		- e.g., the time it takes for office employees to commute to work, the distance you walk in a day, the weight of newborn babies
	- **discrete**
		- observations can only exist at limited values
		- often *countable*
		- e.g., the number of workers in an office, the number of steps you take in a day, the number of babies born each day

> [!note]
> If a variable is quantitative, then differences are meaningful (i.e., numbers are not arbitrary labels)

- Types of categorical (qualitative) variables:
	1. **nominal**
		- unordered descriptions
	2. **ordinal**
		- ordered descriptions
	3. **binary**
		- only 2 mutually exclusive outcomes
		- special type of nominal variable
