# Data visualizations: ethical considerations

- Accuracy and truthfulness
	- Clearly label axes
	- Avoid distorting or misrepresenting data to fit a particular narrative
	- Avoid selecting a plot type that exaggerates or distorts the data
- Context and interpretation
	- Provide enough context for the audience to interpret the visualization accurately
	- Avoid presenting data out of context â†’ misinterpretation
- Accessibility
	- Make visualizations accessible to diverse audiences
		- colours, patterns, labels, and other design elements that consider individuals with colour blindness or other visual impairments
	- Make sure axis labels and values are legible
- Audience consideration
	- Plot type chose should be tailored to audienceâ€™s understanding

## Accuracy and truthfulness
### Example.
![3_welfare.png](/img/user/Files/STA130/3_welfare.png)

- y-axis scale is misleading
	- does not start at 0
- Other categories not included
	- people without a full-time job or not on welfare
- The story:
	- If a person was on welfare, they would count the person *and their dependents* as on welfare
	- Whereas, when they asked people if they have a full time job, they counted the one person
	- ==Inconsistent definition of categories==

### Example.

![3_globalwarming.png|center|600](/img/user/Files/STA130/3_globalwarming.png)

![3_globalwarming2.png|center|500](/img/user/Files/STA130/3_globalwarming2.png)

- First plot picks a subset of data that gives the trend they want
