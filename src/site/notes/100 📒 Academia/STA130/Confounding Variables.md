- In an **observational study** (e.g., Kuriyama et al. 2016), variables are “observed” with no active manipulation of variables/conditions
- → May lead to **confounding**
<br>

- Variables are **confounded** if…
	- their effect on the response variable is mixed up (i.e., confused) and there is no easy way to separate them out
	- → We don’t know which variable(s) are **causal** vs. correlated with other secondary effects
