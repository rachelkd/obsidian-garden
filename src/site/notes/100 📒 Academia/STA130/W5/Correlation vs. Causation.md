- In an observational study, we can only conclude…
	- **association (correlation)** between variables, **not causation**

<br>

- **randomized controlled trial**
	- best way to determine causation
	- randomized:
		- participants assigned randomly to various treatments
	- controlled:
		- only thing that changes is the treatment
	- double blind:
		- the “gold” standard
		- neither participant nor researcher knows whether they are getting “treatment” or are in the “control” group

> [!note]
> Significant differences in outcomes in a RCT are more likely to imply a **causal relationship** rather than just an association.

- When you make a conclusion from a hypothesis test, the only thing you can conclude is…
	- that there is ==either a difference (in one direction if one-sided test, or in general if two-sided test)==, and 
	- ==some known quantity for a one sample test, or between 2 different groups for a two sample test==
