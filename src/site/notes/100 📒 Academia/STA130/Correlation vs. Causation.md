- In an observational study, we can only conclude…
	- **association (correlation)** between variables, **not causation**
<br>

- **randomized controlled trial**
	- best way to determine causation
	- randomized:
		- participants assigned randomly to various treatments
	- controlled:
		- only thing that changes is the treatment
	- double blind:
		- the “gold” standard
		- neither participant nor researcher knows whether they are getting “treatment” or are in the “control” group
