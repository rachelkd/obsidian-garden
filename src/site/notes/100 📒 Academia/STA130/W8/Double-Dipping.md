# Double-dipping in statistics

- Now that we are actively exploring our data to find things and form hypotheses, we need to be careful about **”double-dipping”**
    - If we use the data in one context, we want to be careful about reusing it in a different context
    - This can result in **overfitting**
- i.e., When we explore data, we do not know what the hypotheses are
    - Sometimes, we form hypotheses, ideas, or trends by looking at the data
    - We do not know if these are real trends
    - We use the data to find the trend → We cannot check if the trend is real since we made an assumption that the trend is already real (by looking at the data)
        - Circular!

> [!question] How does this affect us?
> - We use the data to get the cluster centers to set up our 2-sample hypothesis test, so we have engaged in *double-dipping*
> - In fact, we used the data to determine the ==best== cluster centers
>     - That is why the p-value is so small
> - Analogy:
>     - Separating short and tall people, and then looking for a difference between them

# How do we avoid double-dipping?

1. **Do not use all of your data when building your model.**
    - (In machine learning language)
    - Use most of the data for *training* the model, but leave some for *validating* the model (e.g., a practice exam), and some for *testing* the model (e.g, a final exam)
        - e.g., If you look at an answer sheet before you take a practice exam, then you are sort of biased now
2. **Correct for the expected impacts of reusing the data in your test statistics.**
